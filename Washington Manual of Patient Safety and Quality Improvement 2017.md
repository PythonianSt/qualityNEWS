Preface
Health care providers around the world are dedicated to improving the
health and lives of their patients. Sometimes, despite our best efforts, we are
not able to accomplish these goals. At times, we may even harm patients.
For too long these mistakes and errors have been hidden from other health
care workers, hospitals, patients, and the public. The patient safety and
quality improvement movement has worked to improve systems and
processes, prevent errors, and promote transparency when harm occurs.
We hope this manual provides a broad overview for the fundamentals of
patient safety and quality improvement, as well as insight into how these
principles apply to clinical settings. Each chapter of the manual starts with a
clinical vignette and discussion questions meant to show how patient safety
and quality improvement principles apply in the clinical setting. We also list
additional resources at the end of each chapter, which provide more
information about a particular topic. This manual was a joint effort of many
faculty members from multiple departments at Washington University. This
cooperation among professionals with different professional priorities and
backgrounds supports the principle that, in modern health care systems,
effective patient safety and quality improvement needs a multidisciplinary
team approach.
This manual was designed to be a resource for anyone working in
health care and to be applicable to those new to safety and quality
improvement and those with years of experience. The manual can be carried
in the pocket of a lab coat or can be a reference for online access and
reading. We hope that it will become an invaluable tool to support health
care providers in acquiring the knowledge and skills to develop a proactive
approach to patient safety and quality improvement.
We have many people to thank for the creation of the first Patient
Safety and Quality Improvement Manual. First, Dr. Victoria Fraser and Dr.
Alex Evers, the chairs of our departments, motivate us to provide excellent
care to our patients and serve as exemplary role models. Dr. Melvin
Blanchard, Dr. William Powderly, and Dr. Rene' Tempelhoff, our respective
division chiefs, have been instrumental to our success. Dr. Tom De Fer, the
series editor, provided great insight and guidance from the conception of the
manual to the final product. Katie Sharp has kept us on track for our
deadlines and been a wonderful resource.
Last, we would each like to thank our families: Emily—to Andy and
Caroline Rowe for being patient while I spent many nights editing chapters,
and Dr. Dean Fondahn, who taught me what it means to be a great doctor.
Mike—to Laura, Sara, and Alex Lane for their support and understanding
for the many days and nights I spent away trying to improve the lives of
others, and my parents, Hal and Julie, who were role models for the ideals
of fairness and justice. Andrea—to my wife and colleague Laura, who has
rebuilt the life of our family in St. Louis; my encouraging and far-sighted
parents, Ornella and Rodolfo, who, many years ago in Italy, paid for my
first Washington Manual®; and my brother Enrico and my children Bianca,
Pietro, and Angelica for the many insights they give me.
Emily Fondahn, Mike Lane, Andrea Vannucci
Chairman's Note
Colleagues, it is with great pleasure that we are publishing our first edition
of the Washington Manual® of Patient Safety and Quality Improvement.
The Washington Manual® series has long focused on providing regular
updates for medical students, house officers, fellows, and practicing
physicians in internal medicine and various subspecialties.
This new manual provides access to important practical information on
patient safety and quality improvement methods, tools, and competencies
for physicians, medical trainees, and other health professionals. Patient
safety and quality improvement are essential skills for all medical
providers. The literature on patient safety and quality improvement has
expanded dramatically over the past decade and exists in many different
formats and venues. This manual provides key patient safety and quality
improvement information in a concise format so that health professionals
can increase their understanding of basic principles of patient safety and
quality improvement and develop additional skills so that they may apply
patient safety and quality improvement principles into their daily medical
practice.
This manual also serves as a useful resource to address the Graduate
Medical Education initiatives requiring medical training programs to
develop and provide curriculum and real-world experiences in patient safety
and quality improvement, thereby ensuring that future generations of
providers develop competencies in patient safety and quality improvement.
We look forward to your feedback.
Sincerely,
Victoria Fraser, MD

1 Introduction to Patient Safety
and Quality Improvement
Thomas Ciesielski and Victoria J. Fraser
INTRODUCTION
“First, do no harm” should serve as the basic foundation for all interactions
between patients and physicians, health care practitioners, and health care
organizations. The science of medicine has progressed exponentially in the
past century with the evolution of new technology, devices, medications,
and the subspecialization of care. The increasingly complex health care
system leads to fragmented care and an increased risk of medical errors that
may result in harm to patients. The magnitude of patient harm was brought
to the forefront of the nation's attention in 1999 when the Institute of
Medicine (IOM) published the seminal report, To Err is Human: Building a
Safer Health System, that highlighted the risk and impact of medical errors.
The report estimated that there were between 44,000 and 98,000 deaths
occurring each year from preventable errors. If these estimates are indeed
accurate, medical errors would be the eighth leading cause of death.1 A
more recent study using the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI)
Global Trigger Tool estimates that there are between 210,000 and 400,000
patient deaths from preventable medical errors.2 These two estimates vary
widely, and the true number of patient deaths due to medical error will
likely never be known. However, clearly, too many patients are being
harmed by medical errors, and improvements are needed for the health care
system.
In 2001, an equally important report, Crossing the Quality Chasm: A
new Health System for the 21st Century, the IOM noted that health care was
in need of significant changes and discussed specific recommendations to
improve the quality of health care.3 The argument put forth in Crossing the
Quality Chasm is that the “care delivered is not…the care we should
receive…[and] health care…harms too frequently and routinely fails to
deliver its potential benefits.”3 The authors established goals for developing
a 21st-century health care system and proposed six aims for health care
(Table 1-1).3
TABLE

Health 
Care
(Data from: Institute of Medicine. Crossing the Quality Chasm: A New Health System for the 21st
Century. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press; 2001.)
These two reports helped lay the groundwork to promote the new fields of
patient safety and quality improvement (QI) in medical schools, hospitals,
and health care systems. While patient safety and QI are often talked about
in unison, they are actually two distinct fields. The most straightforward
way to think about these two disciplines is like medicine—patient safety is
the diagnostic arm, figuring out what the errors were and what contributed
to the errors, and QI is the treatment arm, fixing the system to prevent the
errors from occurring again.4 The IOM reports challenged hospital leaders
and health care workers to develop new educational programs to change the
culture and processes of health care delivery to ensure that safety and
quality became priorities for the health care system as a whole.
PATIENT SAFETY
Patient safety is, by itself, a nebulous term. To Err is Human defined patient
safety as “freedom from accidental injury.”1 With that serving as a
foundation, the field was further defined by patient safety thought leaders,
including Linda Emanuel, Don Berwick, and Lucian Leape, as “a discipline
in the health care professions that applies safety science methods toward the
goal of achieving a trustworthy system of healthcare delivery…[and] an
attribute of health care systems that minimizes the incidence and impact of
adverse events and maximizes from such events.”5 This manual will
introduce safety science methodologies and discuss strategies to mitigate
errors and how health care systems can learn from errors that occur.
QUALITY IMPROVEMENT
Quality and QI are broad terms that need to be understood in the context of
health care. Quality is roughly defined as “[t]he degree to which health
services for individuals and populations increase the likelihood of desired
health outcomes which are consistent with current professional
knowledge.”6 Thus, the health care system and outcomes are inextricably
linked. With quality broadly defined by the IOM, the U.S. Health Resources
and Services Administration (HRSA) refined the definition to include how
an organization currently operates and the organization's performance as
measured by efficiency, the outcome of care, and patient satisfaction. QI
means achieving a better performance level by changing the current
system/operation; thus, quality is linked to the system, and to improve
quality, the current system needs to change.7 To do so, the HRSA feels that
a QI program must include the following four areas:
1. QI work is performed on systems and processes.
2. Focus on patients.
3. Focus on being part of a team.
4. Focus on the use of data.7
The QI section of this manual will focus on how hospitals can become
highly reliable organizations, QI methodologies, and the future of QI for
health care systems.
HISTORY OF PATIENT SAFETY
AND QUALITY IMPROVEMENT
Although the development of many patient safety and quality initiatives are
often linked to the To Err is Human report,8 other notable events that
predate the report have influenced the evolution of the patient safety and
quality movements in health care. The case of Libby Zion is one such event
that had a profound impact on medical education and house staff training.
Libby Zion was an 18-year-old college freshman who was admitted to a
major New York academic hospital in 1984 with fever, agitation, and
jerking movements of her limbs. She died in the hospital approximately 8
hours after presenting to the emergency room. She likely died from
serotonin syndrome that was not recognized by the intern and second-year
resident who took care of her. Her father, Sidney Zion, fiercely campaigned
for changes in medical training to improve patient safety. This case was one
of the first to garner national attention and put the spotlight on errors
occurring in the hospital. The subsequent litigation from this case
eventually led to the convening of the Bell Commission, whose report
advocated for resident work hour restrictions and eventually led to national
resident work hour restrictions.9,10 Other important cases that influenced
the patient safety and quality movement include the Betsy Lehman and
Josie King cases. In 1994, Betsy Lehman, a Boston Globe reporter, died
after receiving a massive overdose of cyclophosphamide while she was
being treated for breast cancer at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. The
medication error was missed by multiple providers and multiple
departments before reaching the patient.11 As a result of her death in 2004,
the Commonwealth of Massachusetts founded the Betsy Lehman Center for
Patient Safety and Medical Error Reduction, which focuses on improving
patient safety through education and legislation.12 Josie King, an 18-month-
old girl admitted to Johns Hopkins Medical Center in 2001, died from a
combination of preventable medical errors. After her death, Josie's mother,
Sorrel King, founded the Josie King Foundation, which has advanced
patient safety through legislation, formation of patient safety groups, and
partnering with institutions.13
In addition to the IOM reports, many other important developments
have prompted activity from multiple different organizations to improve
safety and quality.
2001: the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)
received $50 million in funding from Congress to fund research in
patient safety.
2002: the Joint Commission (JC, formerly JCAHO) published its own
patient safety goals, and the National Quality Forum (NQF) began
publishing its Serious Reportable Events (SREs) list, which is
commonly referred to as the “never events” list.
2003: Minnesota became the first state to create a statewide error
reporting system. Twenty-six more states have developed error
reporting systems since.
2004: the US government created the Office of the National
Coordinator for Health Information Technology (IT) and the World
Health Organization (WHO) developed a patient safety organization.
2005: the IHI launched its first national campaign to improve patient
safety and congress authorized the creation of patient safety
organizations (the implementation was delayed until 2008).
2008: Medicare launched a “no pay for errors” initiative.
2009: the US congress approved $19 billion for implementation of
electronic health records,8 which was part of the federal stimulus
package.
2010: the Affordable Care Act was enacted by the US legislature,
which contains provisions for patient safety and quality, specifically
aimed at reducing hospital readmissions, which was followed by the
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) enacting policies
to reduce readmissions for four major diagnoses: acute myocardial
infarction (MI), congestive heart failure (CHF), pneumonia, and
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).14,15
LEARNING FROM INDUSTRY
Regrettably, medicine as a whole has been late in implementing QI tools
compared to other industries, such as aviation and chemical manufacturing.
That many of the IOM aims have yet to be achieved means that we in health
care can and need to borrow the tools and concepts used by industry to
create a safer environment for our patients. A paragon of safety is the
aviation industry, and many lessons can be gleaned to make health care
safer.
Safety in the aviation industry is based on a multifactorial approach,
which includes a comprehensive reporting system, programs for setting and
enforcing policies, accident investigation, research to foster new
improvements, team training, the use of simulation, and the development of
standard operating procedures, manuals, and checklists.1,8,16 The
comprehensive Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) is a voluntary
system that is designed to evaluate near misses and other incidents and
quickly disseminates information on these issues to the industry and the
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).1,8 Another major component of
aviation safety is the use of checklists. The development of checklists in
aviation can be traced back to an Army test flight of a Boeing Model 299,
which was a large plane that was complicated to fly. On October 30, 1935,
one of the first test flights ended in tragedy when shortly after takeoff, the
plane stalled and crashed, killing two of the five crew members aboard.
After review, the crash was deemed to be due to pilot error. The plane was
felt to be too complicated to fly and the crash nearly doomed the Boeing
Company. However, a few determined Army test pilots created short
checklists on index cards documenting the essential steps for taxiing,
takeoff, and landing. Subsequent test flights of the Model 299 using these
checklists demonstrated an impeccable safety record making the Boeing
plane a viable option for the military. Following the improved safety with
the checklists, the Army purchased approximately 13,000 of the Model 299
planes and changed the name to the B-17 bomber, which played a
significant role in World War II.17 Checklists continue to be a major factor
in aviation safety and remain in daily use today.
Chemical manufacturing is another potentially dangerous industry that
has been on the forefront of safety and quality. The DuPont Company, one
of the largest chemical and materials manufacturers in the world, has
fostered a culture of safety within the company since the 1800s leading to
an outstanding safety record.1 DuPont has established a culture of safety
principles among its core values that all employees must abide.
Furthermore, the company has a nonpunitive incident-reporting system so
employees can report safety issues, near misses, and incidents.1 This
reporting system allows the company to investigate and learn from near-
miss incidents without an employee fearing punishment. Applying the
lessons learned from these industries will be central to improving the safety
and quality of health care going forward.
TRANSFORMING MEDICINE INTO
A 
HIGH 
RELIABILITY
ORGANIZATIONS
The industries described above are high-risk, high-stakes industries that
have improved their safety records and so are described as high reliability
organizations (HRO).18 HRO share the following characteristics:
Constant awareness among everyone in the organization about the risk
of errors.
A willingness to shift decision making to knowledgeable experts to
respond quickly to errors.
The organization is unwilling to explain away errors.
The organization will invest in ways to empower employees to learn
from experience.19
The patient safety and QI fields aim to transform health care into a HRO by
focusing on ensuring predictable and effective results in an industry that
does have the chance for errors and harm.19 The theory behind HROs has
already been applied to medicine with significant results. Peter Pronovost,
MD, a leader in patient safety, used five features of HROs in designing his
seminal study to decrease catheter-associated bloodstream infections in the
ICU. The five features Pronovost used include the following:
Identifying evidence-based interventions that will improve the health
outcome
Selecting an intervention that will have the most impact on the desired
health outcomes and converting these interventions to behaviors
Measuring baseline performance
Developing measures to evaluate the intervention
Finally, ensuring patients receive the evidence-based interventions18
Certain specialties, including anesthesiology, transfusion medicine, and
infection prevention, have applied principles of HROs to improve care of
patients.
An important feature of a safe organization is the creation of a “just
culture.” A just culture allows frontline employees or personnel to feel
comfortable disclosing errors, even one's own error. The initial report of a
just culture in medicine was in transfusion medicine and was published
after To Err is Human and Crossing the Quality Chasm.1,3 A just culture
takes into account system failings, but has no tolerance for negligence or
conscious disregard of established safety guidelines or reckless behavior.20
Creating a just culture is an important step in creating a safe health care
system.
ERROR 
IDENTIFICATION 
AND
CLASSIFICATION
One of the first steps to improve safety and quality in health care settings is
to understand the epidemiology and causality of safety events and
appropriately classify events. Initial patient safety initiatives established
standard definitions and terminology for errors and adverse events to use in
surveillance, reporting, and research. Medical errors are events that lead to
a negative outcome or have potential for a negative outcome.21 An adverse
event is defined as an unintended injury or complication due to
management or medical care that affects the patient. A near miss is a
medical error that was identified and caught prior to it reaching or harming
the patient.22 Classification and identification of errors, adverse events, and
near misses allow health care systems to analyze events, track trends, and
make improvements to prevent future errors.
Errors can be active or latent. Active errors occur in close relationship
to the activity, and the effects of the error are usually noted immediately,
such as a pilot error that leads to an airplane crash. Latent errors do not
usually occur in close proximity to the activity and so the effects are
delayed. Latent errors are much more difficult to catch and mitigate since
their effects are distant from the action.23 Additional types of errors have
been described for health care. Diagnostic errors include delays in
diagnosis, failure to use indicated tests, or failure to act on results.
Treatment errors can be related to procedures, administering treatments,
dosing errors, delays in acting on tests results, or delays in care. Preventive
errors result from failure to provide indicated prophylaxis or failure of
follow-up. There is also a general category for “other” types of errors that
includes communication errors, equipment/device failures, and systems
failures.1
The JC created a list of sentinel events, which are events that should
never occur and need to be investigated to prevent their reoccurrence.
Examples of sentinel events include death or permanent injury from a
medication error, wrong-site surgery or procedure, hemolytic transfusion
reactions due to blood group incompatibility, and unintended retained
surgical objects. There are also specific lists of sentinel events for inpatient
hospital care, ambulatory care, behavioral health care, critical access
hospitals, laboratory medicine, office-based surgery, long-term care, and
disease-specific care.24 The JC allows individual health care systems to
define additional sentinel events on their own and report these events
voluntarily to the JC.25 After a sentinel event has occurred, it is imperative
to perform a root cause analysis (RCA) to understand the origins of the
error and determine how the error propagated and reached a patient and
how to prevent such errors in the future. RCAs were originally developed to
analyze industrial accidents and seek to answer three fundamental
questions, “what happened, why did it happen, and what can be done to
prevent it from happening again?”25
THE FUTURE OF SAFETY AND
QUALITY
Quality and safety measures are becoming a part of payment models and
facing increased scrutiny by the public. The AHRQ developed Patient
Safety Indicators (PSIs) in 2003, as a way to measure, track, and compare
major complications and adverse events related to hospital admissions.
Hospitals are monitored on a range of complications, including central line–
associated bloodstream infections, pressure ulcers, and postoperative deep
venous thrombosis (DVTs). The PSIs are available to the public, although
the raw data remains difficult to locate efficiently, and thus, the distribution
of comparative data is likely limited.26 Several organizations are now using
the PSIs to compare the quality of hospitals within a region as well as
incorporating the indicators into a pay-for-performance (P4P) model.27 In
2002, the CMS partnered with AHRQ and developed the Hospital
Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS)
tool.28 HCAHPS is a 27-point survey provided to patients to measure their
perceptions of their hospital care, the results of which are now published
online with the goal of enhancing accountability in health care.28 In 2002,
the NQF began tracking SREs list with the goal of creating a uniform
reporting system of major adverse events. These events are serious, largely
preventable, and harmful clinical events that should not occur; the list
includes wrong-site surgery, events due to medical devices, deaths
associated with introduction of a metallic object into a magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) area, and stage III to IV pressure ulcers acquired after
admission.29 The government and private payers acquire and track major
safety and quality data. The public is now able to access this data and can
use this information to select health care providers Health care is an
exceedingly expensive endeavor currently, with the US spending on
medical care in 2010 reaching $2.6 trillion.30 Preventable adverse events
lead to unnecessary costs. Zhan et al. examined Medicare discharge data
from an AHRQ database and linked it to five PSIs (decubitus ulcer,
pneumothorax, post-op hematoma or hemorrhage, post-op deep vein
thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, and post-op sepsis). The study found
that Medicare paid approximately $300 million dollars in 2002 for these
five adverse events.31 This huge number only reflects the cost for five
conditions over 1 year in one payer group. There is potential for huge cost
savings by reducing preventable adverse events, decreasing complication
rates, and limiting unnecessary or overutilized care and services.
CONCLUSION
The importance of safety and quality cannot be overstated in medicine. First
and foremost, our duty as health care providers is to protect patients from
harm, and we must strive to provide safe, effective, patient-centered, timely,
efficient, and equitable care to individual patients and to populations. We
must challenge ourselves to continuously improve the health care delivery
system as a whole to ensure the safest and highest quality care possible. We
must learn from medical errors to prevent them from reoccurring in the
future. HRO engender a culture and environment that is dedicated to safety
and improvement at all levels including leadership, frontline caregivers, and
all staff. Furthermore, health care is becoming more and more accountable
with publicly reported quality metrics, meaning that practitioners, hospitals,
and health care systems will likely be judged by their outcomes, quality,
and safety by the public and by the payers.
This manual was created with these principles in mind. This book is
designed to provide important and useful information on patient safety and
quality for current and future generations of health care workers including
physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and anyone involved in patient care. The
manual will introduce and broadly define key topics related to ensuring
quality in health care and introduce major QI tools as well as introduce
patient safety principles, describe methods to enhance patient safety, and
provide necessary information on creating a culture of safety in hospitals
and health care systems. The topics covered in this manual are wide
ranging, and the manual is organized into three sections, QI, patient safety,
and safety issues for specific areas. The QI section addresses high reliability
QI tools, models for quality, accountability and reporting, health care IT,
preventable harm, health care–associated infections, and coding and
documentation. The patient safety section addresses creating a culture of
safety, event analysis, disclosure of adverse events and errors, teamwork
and communication, the role of human factors to improve safety and
quality, cognition and decision making, and tools to improve safety.
The section on specific areas is written by experts in specific clinical
fields and addresses how a safety and QI program can be designed and
implemented in anesthesia, intensive care units, the emergency department,
pediatrics, radiology, psychiatry, ambulatory care, and laboratory and
pathology services. In addition, there are specific chapters on medication
safety and safety and quality issues related to hospital readmissions and

transfers of care that address issues common to several clinical disciplines.
Finally, there is a glossary of important terms located at the end of the
manual, and cases, methods, and tools are described to facilitate readers'
engagement in patient safety and quality activities.
Although there are many important comprehensive textbooks on
individual aspects of patient safety and quality, we believe that this manual
provides the readers with an overview of current knowledge in patient
safety and quality in an easy to understand and retain format. Furthermore,
we are confident that it provides an introduction and a guide to the methods
and tools that can be implemented into your own practice and help you to
become a patient safety and quality champion in your institution.

Introduction

Quality
Improvement
Adam Carlisle and Melvin Blanchard
CLINICAL VIGNETTE
As part of her Internal Medicine residency program, Emily receives
quarterly reports regarding the quality of care she provides her patients with
diabetes. Her last report showed that the majority of her patients with
diabetes were not at goal for screening of neuropathy. By evaluating the
process for screening patients, she determined that she often forgot to do a
foot exam and the monofilaments were not readily available. She created a
new process where nurses would put a monofilament on the front of all
patients with diabetes charts as a reminder to perform the neuropathy
screen. After instituting this process, her screening for neuropathy improved
to 95%.
Why is quality improvement important in health care?
What are the first steps in starting a quality improvement project?
Health care systems routinely fail to deliver high-quality, evidence-based
care to patients. Quality improvement (QI) work strives to remove gaps
between the care provided and the care that should have been provided.
Practitioners need a brief and practical guide to information about effective
QI and interventions. The modern health care “systems” evolved out of
necessity, not intentional design.1 While patients are individuals and each
presents with different clinical challenges, they often share the same
systems and encounter the same obstacles to care. QI methods seek not to
limit the freedom or dictate the terms of the patient–provider relationship
but to ensure the care plan is carried out as intended—especially with
regard to those elements that are most critical and common. QI methods
seek to increase health care value by focusing on what helps patients the
most and how we can do those things better.2,3
Quality health care has been defined in numerous different ways;
perhaps, the most commonly used definition was composed by the Institute
of Medicine and is framed by six central aims (Table 2-1). Poor quality in
health care leads to poor patient outcomes and costs the health care system
limited resources. Three types of poor quality in health care are overuse,
underuse, and errors.4 An example of overuse is repeating a chest x-ray
because the initial x-ray was not available in the electronic medical record
(EMR). Underuse includes not performing a colonoscopy for colorectal
cancer screening on an appropriate patient. Opportunities to provide
effective, timely, and patient-centered care are often missed (Table 2-2).

SYSTEM 
OF 
PROFOUND
KNOWLEDGE
Edward W. Deming created the idea of improvement known as the “System
of Profound Knowledge.” The concept of profound knowledge refers to the
understanding that will lead to improvement, rather than simply the
knowledge about a process from a subject matter expert. The four
components of Deming's System of Profound Knowledge are shown in
Figure 2-1. When considering ways to improve some component of health
care, one must recognize and consider these four concepts before initiating
a QI project.
Figure 2-1 Deming's system of profound knowledge.
IMPROVING 
QUALITY 
IN
HEALTH CARE
Many health care providers are currently striving to provide quality patient
care but are failing to do so. The problem facing health care is a failure of
execution, not effort. Edward Deming famously illustrated this principle in
his “red bead experiment.” When asked by industry leaders how processes
could be improved, Deming filled a bowl with red and white beads, stating
red beads represented a poor outcome and white beads represented the
desired outcome. He would explain to the employees that “the goal is to
pick the white beads.” Then, he would blindfold employees and asked them
to choose a bead from the bowl at random. When employees chose white
beads, they were praised, and when they chose red beads, they were
berated. In this example, the employees are doomed to fail by picking a red
bead because of the design of the process. This experiment illustrates that
workers are often blamed for defects in the system, even though they have
no control over the system.
When processes are complex and poorly understood, managers
commonly attribute errors to the performance of individual employees,
while the root cause of errors is systemic and process related.5 Health care
delivery cannot be improved solely by culling out providers performing
under the mean. Instead, interventions need to improve the mean
performance of existing health care providers by changing the underlying
system and process. This improvement requires an understanding of
systems, data collection, implementation of changes, and measuring the
effect of system alterations. Interventions must focus on the most common,
most dangerous, most rate limiting, most costly problems in health care.
Resources used to produce health care are limited, including time. The
concept of opportunity cost dictates that the cost of consuming these
resources is not simply the value of the resource if left unconsumed but is
instead the total value of the resource if used in the next best possible way.
For example, if a doctor spends one additional hour per day manually
writing prescriptions that could potentially be printed from an electronic
medical record, then a hospital system must consider the daily cost of the
current system as the hourly salary of that doctor but also the potential
revenue foregone by an additional hour of patient evaluation, assuming
there are patients available and in need of physician evaluation during that
hour.
Furthermore, the theory of constraints can be extremely helpful when
considering complex process occurring both in series and in parallel as with
patient care to maximize or minimize a given outcome. The theory of
constraints states that scarce resources should be devoted toward improving
the significant bottleneck in a production process.6 Continuing our example
from above, if a health care system leadership is determining whether to use
their limited resources to enable prescription printing from their electronic
medical record, or to integrate the currently separate inpatient and
outpatient electronic medical records with the goal of improving patient
throughput time, then leadership should determine which steps in patient
care represent the greatest bottleneck to throughput and which of the two
above interventions would address this most effectively. The theory of
constraints could also be applied to these scenarios with intent to maximize
revenue or even minimize errors. This is accomplished by measuring the
degree to which each of the multiple steps of patient care is most critical to
the desired outcome.
METHODS 
OF 
QUALITY
IMPROVEMENT USED IN HEALTH
CARE
There are several different methods on QI currently used in health care:
Six Sigma is an “improvement approach that seeks to find and
eliminate the causes of mistakes or defects in business processes by
focusing on outputs that are of critical importance to the customer.”7
Six Sigma seeks to eliminate defects by using the DMAIC (Define,
Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control) methodology of process
improvement. A set of process improvement tools developed by
Motorola 1985, the name is derived from sigma, the statistic
designation for standard deviation with the goal of manufacturing
processes yielding six standard deviations of defect-free production.
This is equivalent to 99.99966% of products being defect free or 3.4
defects per million opportunities.8
Lean, termed by John Krafcik in 1988, was originally developed in the
automobile manufacturing industry as an outgrowth of Toyota
Production Systems. Lean focuses on removing unnecessary waste
from a process, increasing efficiency and improving workflow, while
preserving value. Specifically, lean mythologies seek to remove waste
or “muda” in seven areas (Table 2-3).
The Plan, Do, Study, Act (PDSA) cycle is practical, simple, and thus
commonly used. The PDSA cycle mirrors the natural iterative process
of trial-and-error problem solving. It is most effective when addressing
a singular care process and must be repeated multiple times as the first
cycle often uncovers new process problems that should be addressed in
the next cycle (see Chapter 4, Quality Improvement Tools).
Continuous quality improvement as a management strategy was first
widely implemented in Japanese manufacturing where it was termed
“Kaizen.”9 It is implemented broadly in many forms throughout health
care.

While originally distinct in design, these methodologies are often used in
combination. A single QI project should only use methods and tools as
needed. Each may be applied to many types of QI interventions including
rationing, education, feedback, incentives, penalties, organization, checklist
utilization, EMR, human factor process reform, and team training.
COMPONENTS OF A QUALITY
IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
A project charter is useful to communicate and confirm agreement between
the problem-solving team and management. The project charter should
include the goal, project background scope, measures, business case, team
members, required resources, projected cost and saving, planned initial
activities, and estimated time of completion.An aim statement should be
included as part of the goal. It should be specific, measurable, appropriate,
result oriented, and time scheduled. An example might be “The medicine
clinic aims to increase monofilament testing and documentation on patients
with diabetes from 60% to 80% by December 31, 2016.” The measures
should be connected with the goals and outcomes of the charter. Generally,
most projects have three to eight measures, which are a mix of process,
outcome, and balancing measures. A driver diagram is a structured logic
tree to visually display the aim, the primary drivers that contribute to the
aim, the secondary drivers that influence the primary drivers, and specific
change ideas to test10 (Fig. 2-2).
Figure 2-2 Example of a driver diagram for diabetes care.
A vital component to any successful QI project is a good team. Important
roles to fill on the team include a team leader with authority to make
change, an executive sponsor to help overcome organizational roadblocks,
subject matter experts and/or frontline workers (e.g., nurses, medical
assistants, physicians), and an improvement expert to guide the team and
patients or customers.
CONDUCTING 
A 
QUALITY
IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
There are four basic steps to conducting a QI project: develop a change, test
a change, implement a change, and spread a change.
Developing a Change
All improvement requires change, but not all change is an improvement
(Improvement Guide). There are two types of change. Reactive change or
first-order change consists of doing more or less of an existing process. This
is reversible and requires minimal new learning. Fundamental change or
second-order change represents a fundamentally different process that is not
reversible and requires new learning to execute.11 Determining what type of
change to make requires understanding the system and the theory behind
the change. A driver diagram is one tool to help organize the theory of the
system, helps the team understand how factors are connected, and facilitates
the process of identifying factors to address.
Deciding what change to make is not always easy. People often
perseverate on a few common ideas. For example, many thoughts start with
“more of the same,” meaning more physicians, more exam rooms, or more
money would fix the problem. Rather, the system would likely benefit from
an overall redesign. Another common pitfall is searching for the perfect
change. A team may spend hours, weeks, or months debating what type of
change to make and attempt to map out all the details of the change, leading
to a paralysis of action. There are five approaches to assist teams with
developing a change:
1. Logical thinking about the current system a. Often, mapping out a
process with a flow diagram and bringing together a multidisciplinary
group can lead to good ideas for change.
2. Learning from others a. Across the world, other teams are probably
struggling with the same problems and some may have shown
improvement through their changes. Reaching out to other health care
systems and reviewing the literature can provide tested ideas for
change. Additionally, as mentioned in previous chapters, health care
can look at other industries for change concepts.
3. Using technology a. Technology, if tested and implemented
appropriately, can improve a system. However, automating a bad
system or having a technology that is inconsistent may only make
things worse.
4. Creative thinking a. Creative thinking can help a team obtain new ideas.
Provocative thinking exercises and brainstorming can spur creative
thinking.
5. Using change concepts a. A change concept is “a general notion or
approach to change that has been found to be useful in developing
specific ideas for changes that lead to improvement”12 (Table 2-4).

Concepts
Testing a Change
Testing change helps build knowledge about a system and teaching if a
change will result in an improvement. Often, testing is done through PDSA
cycles. Begin by testing on a small scale, and use the testing to build
knowledge over time. The first test may just be on 1 patient. This strategy
builds buy-in and prevents large-scale failure. The scale of the testing
should be proportional to the current commitment to change within the
organization, the degree of belief that the change will lead to improvement,
and the cost of failure (Table 2-5).

Testing

Approach to Enhancing Organizational Performance. 2nd ed. San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass
Publishers; 2009.)
Repeated small changes are often better than large changes as each
change has the potential of unintended effects on other patient care
processes. Unintended effects can be identified and negative effects
remedied with minimal harm if changes are small and improved with each
repeated iteration. With each test, collect data on the system and evaluate if
the predictions made were correct. Testing should be done under a wide
range of conditions. This strategy will help build buy-in that the change will
lead to improvement and help the team identify problems with the
improvement idea.
Implementing a Change
Implementation of a change is making the change an integral part of the
system. It may require a broad and permanent change to the routine
operations of the organization. During the implementation process, all other
interacting systems also need to be evaluated to help support the change.
Implementation must not ignore portions of the organization involved in
documentation, 
hiring, 
training, 
and 
compensation. 
Failure 
of
implementation can often be traced to inadequate preliminary testing. The
same PDSA cycles used for testing can be used for implementation. There
are several key implementation areas a team should consider:
1. Standardization— policies and procedures 2. Documentation—job
descriptions 
3. 
Training—staff 
education 
4. 
Measurement—
information flow 5. Resourcing—equipment
The human side of change is another important consideration when
implementing a change. The human response to change follows a bell-
shaped curve with a few innovators, some early adopters, and a few
laggards, while most people will either be in the early or late majority.
People will often have a strong emotional reaction to change (Table 2-6).
TABLE 
2-6 
Human 
Response 
to 
Change
(Data from: www.ihi.org/resources/Pages/Changes/UsingChangeConceptsforImprovement.aspx)
These reactions may be due to feeling of change in autonomy,
programmed behavior, and stability with the current routine, real or
perceived limits on resources, and a limited focus. Strategies to mitigate
these barriers include creating the will among the staff for the change,
providing information about why the change is being made and how it will
affect staff, publicizing the change, allowing time for adequate training, and
maintaining a feedback loop.
Spreading a Change
Spreading a change is implementing a good idea beyond the initial location.
The positive effects of a change are determined not only by the fundamental
improvement offered by the change itself but also the degree to with the
change is used successfully throughout the organization. For example, if an
intensive care unit develops a bundle that decreases central line–associated
infection rates, this bundle should be spread to other hospital units. The IHI
developed a framework for spread, which includes:
1. Strong leadership 2. Better ideas
3. Setup
4. Social systems
5. Measurement and feedback systems
Sustaining a Change
After a change has been made, continuing to monitor the system is critical.
Often, a team may focus on measuring before the intervention and after the
intervention. However, the focus should be on measuring continually to
evaluate data over time. This monitoring can be done with run charts and
control charts (discussed in Chapter 4).
MEASURING QUALITY
Measurement is an integral part of continuous QI.13 Measuring quality in
health care has been more difficult than in other industries due to the
difficulty in determining whether patient outcomes are attributable to the
quality of health care delivery or to patients' baseline health status, which
can vary widely. However, quality can now be measured reliably in the
health care industry by a variety of methods.14 While measuring quality
care is traditionally viewed as distinctly separate from providing quality
care, there is mounting evidence to show that the two are inextricably
linked.15 It serves two critical purposes: first, to determine which of
multiple processes within a system yield the best health outcomes and
second, to determine how often known best practices are being applied to
appropriate patients. Measurement can vary widely by type, assessment
method, source, and scope.
Health care quality can be measured on the basis of structure, process,
and outcome (Table 2-7)16:
TABLE 
2-7

Measurements

Assess 
Quality
(Data from: Donabedian A. Explorations in Quality Assessment and Monitoring. Vol. 1: The
Definition of Quality and Approaches to its Assessment. Ann Arbor, MI: Health Administration Press;
1980.)
1. Structural measures quantify the available resources of health care
systems, such as number of nurses, hospital beds, or phlebotomy
supplies.
2. Process measures quantify of the diagnostic and therapeutic processes
that occur while caring for the patient, such as the number of patient
with heart failure that were discharged with a β-blocker prescribed.
3. Outcome measures quantify the health status of patients after they
received health care; mortally, morbid and even quality-of-life
measures are examples.
4. Balancing measures quantify any of the changes during a QI project
other than the primary outcome of the QI project to ensure that other
systems or processes are not disrupted negatively. For example, if a
project were designed to improve diagnosis of pulmonary embolism
with the introduction of different imaging protocols, kidney function
could be a balancing measure. A balancing measure can be a structural,
process, or outcome measure.
Each of these different measures has respective strengths and
weaknesses that are important to consider. Structural and process measures
are useful if proven to correlate with outcomes and are often easier to obtain
than outcome measures. Process data can be more sensitive than outcome
data as every process error does not lead to a poor outcome. However, the
reliability of process measures is dependent on the degree that a process is
known to influence outcomes, since poor patient outcomes are often not
apparent until sometime after the measured health care is provided. When
comparing outcomes data, it is important to measure baseline health. If
differences in baseline health are not accounted for properly, then outcomes
represent only the final state of health, not improvement associated with the
care delivered. Most QI projects will have a variety of outcome, process,
and balancing measures that are tracked over time.
Data for the measurement of quality in health care can be obtained from
multiple sources including the clinical medical record, billing/insurance
records, survey, or direct observation. The best source of data depends on
the purpose for which the data will be used.13 For example, educational
counseling regarding diet for patients with diabetes could be measured by
patient survey, medical record, or direct audio/video recording. Which
source is best depends on whether quality care is linked to physicians
completing the counseling, patients' memory of the counseling, or
counseling being documented so other therapies are considered
appropriately in the future.
Data must be measured in units appropriately scoped to the QI project
at hand. For example, if a hospital wishes to reduce the average time to
initial evaluation after arriving in the emergency department by 40 minutes
but can only measure these times in hours, a new measurement system must
be created. Data collection should not be a separate labor-intensive process
demanding the time of providers at the opportunity cost of actually
providing patient care. Systems should support efforts of frontline providers
to measure their performance daily and adjust accordingly.
Data collected differently under different circumstances become
unreliable and will be insufficient to determine whether changes are due to
the interventions tested or from inconsistencies in data collection.
Developing an operational definition of measurement is necessary to insure
collected data are reliable and useful. An operational definition requires (1)
agreement on a measuring device, (2) a degree of measurement precision,
and (3) a criteria for judgment. For example, when trying to measure if
decubitus ulcers have improved, one must determine the measuring device
(visual estimation or tape measure or caliper), the degree of measurement
precision (units of one centimeter or one-tenth of a centimeter), and the
criteria for judgment (what is a decubitus ulcer and at what points of the
skin lesion do you measure).
Measurement allows for identification of poor quality care; however,
the further into the care process that this poor quality is identified, the more
dangerous it is to the patient and the more costly it is to remedy.17 For
example, if an intravenous antibiotic is compounded incorrectly by a
pharmacist, this will result in decreased quality of care, but the magnitude is
dependent on how early or late in the care process this error is identified. If
the error is detected by the pharmacist, the cost is only minimal wasted
materials and one provider's time. If the error is detected by a nurse at
bedside, more staff members' time was wasted and the patient's outcome
could be worse due to delay in appropriate treatment. If a patient receives
antibiotic before the error is detected, he or she may suffer kidney injury or
much worse, as well as incur greater cost for further care related to the
error. Fortunately, multiple tools are available to measure quality of care
effectively18 (see Chapter 4, Quality Improvement Tools).
QUALITY 
IMPROVEMENT
VERSUS CLINICAL RESEARCH
QI and clinical research share the common goal of seeking to improve
patient care by the combined application of intervention and repeated
measurement. Clinical research requires approval from a board of ethics,
the institutional review board (IRB) in the US, whose oversight is meant to
insure the safety of patients. QI efforts are currently exempt from required
IRB approval. It can be difficult to determine if a given project is primarily
categorized as QI or clinical research; thus, the key characteristic of each is
reviewed here (Table 2-8).19,20 Of note, projects involving vulnerable
population could benefit from the oversight of an ethical review committee.
Vulnerable populations include students, employees, children, pregnant
women, prisoners, active military personnel, individuals who have impaired
decision-making capacity, or those who are educationally or economically
disadvantaged.

THE 
BUSINESS 
CASE 
FOR
QUALITY IMPROVEMENT
As described in the text “Quality is Free,” improving quality should not cost
and, in fact, may reduce cost as “quality is the price of nonconformance.”21
A process that produces defective products leads to costs from (1) screening
to identify defective product, (2) rework of detected defects, and (3) costs
related to defects that reach customers. Joseph Juran terms this phenomenon
“the cost of poor quality.”22 A process designed to produce products that
consistently conform to specifications eliminates these costs. In 2004, the
American Society for Quality released a white paper report entitled
“Making the Economic Case for Quality,” which summarizes a large body
of empiric evidence of the economic impact of an organizational focus on
QI. It concludes that the impact of quality management practice on bottom-
line measures, market measures, and internal operating measures of profit is
significantly positive.23 Correspondingly, health care payors are beginning
to demand more value for each dollar they spend. Health care cost could
potentially be decreased while maintaining the same health outcomes with
appropriate use of preventative medicine and providing treatments in a less
resource-intensive setting, such as a primary care clinic.
KEY POINTS
Quality improvement aims to make health care safe, effective,
patient centered, timely, efficient, and equitable.
Components of a quality improvement project include a charter;
an aim statement; a driver diagram, outcome, process, and
balancing measures; methods to display data; and a high-
functioning team.
Testing a change can be done through a series of PDSA cycles,
which should start small then be scaled up.

3 Building High Reliability in the
Health Care System

CLINICAL VIGNETTE
You are an Anesthesiology attending supervising two resident cases in the
operating room (OR) today and the fellow will be arriving late.
Case #1 is a thoracic aortic aneurysm repair and general anesthesia has
been induced, with invasive monitors are in place, the patient is stable, and
the surgical procedure is underway. You are called to start Case #2, which
was delayed due to multiple transplants all night, resulting in extra time
needed to properly restock your supplies. Case #1 is going well, and you
ask the resident to send a blood gas sample to the lab. Point-of-care testing
in the OR is not currently available because the analyzer was out for repair
so the specimen goes to the central laboratory along with samples from
several ORs.
While you are in Case #2, the lab calls with a critical lab value for Case
#1. The circulating nurse is busy getting a new instrument for the surgeon
who is encountering some bleeding and quickly shouts to your resident that
the hemoglobin is 6.3 before going to retrieve the new clamp. The patient
becomes hypotensive at this point in the case and requires frequent doses of
vasopressors to maintain adequate blood pressure. When the resident hears
the hemoglobin is 6.3 with hypotension and acute blood loss, the patient is
transfused two units of packed red blood cells for presumed hemorrhagic
shock.
At about that time, the OR tech arrives with the lab result slip and the
hemoglobin value is 10.8. You call the lab to inquire about the discrepancy
and they tell you they realized they called the wrong room because they had
multiple critical values and they were too busy dispensing blood for
bleeding patients at that moment to remedy the error. The surgical bleeding
has now ended and your patient has received an unnecessary transfusion of
two units of blood.
What are the definitions and characteristics of a high reliability
organization?
Describe other types of complex system theory that may be applied to
the health care industry.
INTRODUCTION
Hospitals today provide increasingly acute and complex care to sicker
patients than ever before. The potential for hazard is constant, and prospect
of failure can have tragic outcomes. There is increasing pressure to provide
safer care to our patients. Whether it is the wake-up call of the Institute of
Medicine report,1 the desire to more rapidly and seamlessly implement
clinical evidence into practice, new regulatory and reimbursement realities,
or the public reporting of safety and quality indices, the health care industry
is now motivated to make clinical processes more reliable and safe in this
high-stakes environment. Other industries such as the commercial airline
industry and the nuclear power industry have functioned with high
reliability in such a high-stakes environment for many years. Recent study
of these high-risk industries has led to identification of features and
characteristics that could be employed by the health care industry in its
quest to move toward high reliability.2
HIGH 
RELIABILITY
ORGANIZATIONS
A high reliability organization (HRO) is one that has succeeded in avoiding
catastrophes in an environment where normal accidents can be expected
due to constant risk and complexity. HROs maintain a high degree of safety
despite functioning in hazardous conditions.3 Also implicit in this definition
is consistency over time. There are varying philosophies and definitions of
an HRO; however, several characteristics emerge as common principles.
First and foremost, HROs maintain a culture of safety. Not simply a
company motto but a defining atmosphere at every level of the
organization. Weick and Sutcliffe refer to this as collective mindfulness3
and further describe the characteristics that are essential. These
organizations are preoccupied with failure,3,4 demonstrate a passionate
commitment to excellence,5 and strive for a zero-defect environment.6 In
such an environment, everyone is keenly aware that even small errors can
lead to catastrophe. This culture is so pervasive that staff at every level is
encouraged and even required to share concerns and insight, knowing that
leadership and team members alike will defer to their expertise.3,7,8
Another common feature of HROs is that they pay close attention to
operations.3 They understand how their systems and processes can affect
the entire organization. These types of issues clearly played a role in the
example above. HROs focus on predicting problems and understand that
their systems may fail in ways that they did not anticipate. Deficiencies are
actively pursued as opposed to the common practice of responding only to
adverse events. This may be accomplished through regular reporting and
rounding to identify issues before problems arise.5 There is also a
reluctance to accept simple explanations when events occur.3 These
organizations always dig deeper to understand all potential sources of
failure.4 Once these deficiencies are identified, HROs have in place and
employ powerful process improvement to resolve them.5
When problems arise, as they inevitably do, the HRO must be very
resilient.3 An HRO understands that, despite considerable safeguards, a
system may fail. They utilize systems of care that catch errors before they
can reach patients, yet when failures happen they know how to respond, and
use swift problem solving to contain errors and improvise to keep systems
functioning.8 Because of this resilience, HRO health care teams can
maintain constant vigilance amidst staffing crises, incessant interruptions,
and unexpected changes in patient status.8
CREATING AN INFRASTRUCTURE
FOR QUALITY
Engaging Leadership
Becoming an HRO requires a true long-term commitment to quality.
Having the support of the board of directors and senior leadership is
essential to this process.9,10 The role of leadership is to make safety and
quality a high priority focus for their organization. They must frame the
agenda, align incentives, and ensure that the overall strategy is aligned with
the mission.5,11 The importance of a fully engaged and supportive
leadership cannot be underestimated. Emerging evidence suggests that
board's engagement in quality may actually affect organizational
performance and patient outcomes.10 Interviews of hospital board members
and CEOs revealed that significant progress is needed in educating hospital
leadership about quality improvement (QI) and in recruiting board members
with safety expertise.10
The Role of Middle Managers
Research on health care innovation implementation has focused on the roles
of executives and physicians, but middle managers are largely
overlooked.12 Middle managers function as the intermediary between the
executives and the front line. They have the ability to exert upward
influence by collating information and elevating issues, as well as
downward influence via their interface with the front line. They are the
implementers of strategy and are responsible for conveying the company
culture to the frontline workers, both through their actions and process
development. Their behaviors must consistently support the mission.
Role of Trainees
Trainees are an integral part of many medical services, yet they sometimes
do not view themselves as a member of the working team, and therefore not
responsible for processes. In actuality, they are important members of the
team but require education about their roles and the importance of their
participation in established processes. Work flows must be designed to
incorporate revolving team members and to ensure that they are properly
introduced to the culture of safety. Additional efforts may be required to
properly educate trainees about their roles on the team, and it is essential to
provide this training. In addition, this is a valuable opportunity to influence
behavior early in their careers, which may contribute significantly to a
culture of patient safety and the development of HROs.13
Responsibility of Frontline Workers
Much of the direct knowledge for successful operations resides here at the
front line where the core defining activity for a particular industry takes
place.14 Those working here hold the keys to successful processes. Their
knowledge and expertise should be valued, and they must feel empowered
to speak up with thoughts and concerns.14,15
MANAGING A COMPLEX SYSTEM
Complexity and Normal Accidents
Health care is a high-risk and complex system characterized by multiple
component parts that are often tightly coupled. Even trivial failures in two
or more system elements may lead to catastrophic outcomes when those
failures interact in critical and unanticipated ways. The paradoxical concept
of “normal accident” cannot be attributed to poor design, faulty equipment,
flawed processes, or operator error as discrete failures but rather is due to
the interactive complexity of the system itself. Tightly coupled systems
where subcomponents have prompt and significant impact on each other
make accidents “normal” or inevitable.
In considering the clinical vignette above, the primary cause of the
unnecessary transfusion was not the absent fellow, the unstocked cart, the
broken blood gas analyzer, or the defective surgical clamp, all component
failures that by themselves might have otherwise been insufficient to
produce harm. Instead, the unpredictable and interdependent ways those
and several other failures converged and the fact that those failures could
not be immediately observed or understood by the operator led to the
accidental transfusion.
It is likely that an investigation of the accident above would cite
“operator error” as the primary failure. An appropriate read-back technique
was not employed by the nurse and lab tech on the phone because of the
urgent need for a surgical clamp and the anesthesiology resident did not
pursue confirmation of the verbal report prior to administering blood given
the feasibility of low hemoglobin in the clinical context. In his work on
normal accident theory, Charles Perrow cautions that operator error, cited in
60–80% of accident investigations, is to be expected when operators must
respond to anomalous information and unforeseen failures for which no
amount of training or standardized operating procedures can prepare
them.16 This is not to suggest organizations should “throw in the towel” and
accept accidents as unavoidable and operators unaccountable, but it does
highlight the paradoxical demands on organizations in managing risk. On
one hand, operators must follow centralized and standardized policies and
protocols and avoid taking actions whose consequences have not been
analyzed. In contrast, operators must also respond correctly and quickly to
all incidents and failures including those that organizations could not
imagine and for which operators must think and act independently. It is not
reasonable to expect any complex organization to meet both of these criteria
without incident. If accidents in complex systems are “normal,” then health
care organizations must develop strategies to learn from failures and to gain
insight into the unplanned and unimaginable.
Ultrasafe versus Resilient Systems
Human factors research uses scientific methods to study why errors occur
and how to improve system performance and prevent accidental harm.17
Human factors is not about eliminating human error or teaching people to
modify their behavior, but designing systems that are resilient to
unanticipated events. Ultrasafe systems such as civil aviation and nuclear
power industries have adopted strategies that have yet to be applied in
health care.18,19 Becoming an ultrasafe industry requires acceptance of
certain constraints on activity and a conscious trade-off among safety goals,
performance goals, and professional autonomy. Health care must address
the same barriers that other industries have faced in striving toward
ultrasafety with a few additional industry-specific challenges. The
magnitude and impact of human error are unclear in medicine because risks
are not homogeneous (i.e., elective vs. emergent conditions) and may be
attributed to disease, patient factors, medical decisions, or implementation
of those decisions.
Several barriers to reducing unsafe medical care have been identified,
chief among them are the need to control maximum production, the use of
the equivalent actor principle, and the need for standardization of
practices.20 Increasing economic pressures on health care organizations and
providers drive productivity and financial performance goals that may
compromise safety and lead to adverse events. When the maximum
performance of systems or individuals is unlimited or even encouraged,
autonomous decisions are tolerated without regulation or constraints and the
risk for adverse events increases. While advances in medicine would not be
possible without a willingness to push boundaries or attempt the
unthinkable (i.e., organ transplantation or cardiopulmonary bypass), such
extraordinary practices are associated with higher levels of risk. Certain
sectors of health care such as trauma surgery or labor and delivery are
subject to unstable conditions including unpredictable demands, variable
patient acuity, and inconsistent team composition, making them inherently
less safe. Most sectors of health care, including elective surgery and
anesthesia, operate under more stable conditions where achieving
ultrasafety will require production limitations, practice standardization, and
constraints on provider autonomy. As demonstrated in the vignette above,
however, such distinctions may become blurred in a complex health care
system where stable and unstable conditions coexist, that is, multiple
transplants the prior night strained the system and led to a failure in
stocking supply carts for the elective schedule, delayed the OR schedule,
overwhelmed intensive care unit (ICU) bed capacity, and created a
bottleneck in post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) patient flow. Systemic
thinking and planning remain a challenge in health care where teams must
anticipate consequences across departments and services.
Another difficult barrier in health care is the concept of the “equivalent
actor” in which professionals must abandon their identity as individual
craftsmen and accept their equivalence to peers in a highly standardized
practice.20 Anesthesiologists, radiologists, pharmacists, and pilots are
examples of professionals that have embraced this concept and perform
interchangeably in a highly standardized practice with safety rates that far
exceed those who have not yet made that transition.
Unintended 
Consequences 
of 
Quality
Initiatives
When a review of a patient safety event leads to a determination that the
cause is “human error,” it is not uncommon for health care organizations to
try and modify the behavior of an individual or group through education or
retraining.21 Unfortunately, this approach has been shown to be ineffective
or weak as a safety intervention, and when adopted as the primary solution
to eradicate “human error,” the organization may fall short of truly
achieving reductions in harm.17 Another common approach to adverse
events is to focus on protocols, rules, and checklists.
Safety rules continue to grow rapidly and are essential in a safe system,
but the accumulation of guidelines and checklists that are intended to
defend against error and constrain human action may make the system
overly complex and burdensome. Even when well developed and accepted
by end users, checklist repetition has the potential to produce complacency
and cognitive drift. If a system is designed with only a limited sphere of
safe operation, violations are very likely to occur under real-world
conditions.22,23
In his work on the subject, Amalberti explains the time course and the
manner in which external pressures drive organizations or individuals to
violate safety rules and migrate to the boundaries of safety.24 He advises
that while violations are not desirable, they are best understood as
adaptations to evolving medical knowledge, staffing, and environment and
must be managed at a clinical level, modifying procedures and standards
accordingly.
In recent years, much has been published and celebrated about so-called
“zero risk” and “never events” in health care.25,26 Insurance networks have
limited reimbursement for several health care–associated conditions on the
grounds that they are preventable. This flawed concept ignores the fact that
sources of risk in health care are complex and not exclusively attributable to
error. Using surgical infections as an example, patients living in chronic
care facilities, having higher-risk procedures, requiring more invasive care,
or longer length of stay are more likely to develop infection than a low-risk
patient undergoing a short “clean” procedure, even when precautions are
taken and no “mistakes” are committed. Accepting the notion of zero risk or
zero tolerance threatens the very risk management efforts behind voluntary
reporting and root cause analyses designed to understand adverse events
and improve safety and quality.27 Carlet et al. suggest the preferred term
“zero tolerance to passivity” to distinguish risk reduction from zero risk.
The concern for unintended consequences in the quest for safer health
care cannot be overemphasized. Just as clinicians need to learn from their
mistakes in their patient care, so too should policy makers. Extrapolation
from clinical studies or adoption of unproven, unvalidated measures to
develop guidelines and performance indicators can lead to harm. Time to
first antibiotic (TFAD) is a measure developed for patients presenting with
community-acquired pneumonia, with a target of antibiotic administration
within 4 hours from presentation to the hospital. Wachter et al. describe the
flaws with the first truly dangerous measure in the era of public quality
reporting:
“In the days before measurement of TFAD, patients with uncertain
diagnoses would continue to be evaluated until the diagnosis was clarified.
However, the TFAD standard completely transformed the dynamic: Faced
with a patient who might have pneumonia, the emergency medicine
physician now has a strong incentive (almost always buttressed by social
pressure and sometimes by financial incentives) to give antibiotics before 4
hours have passed, even when he or she is still unsure of the diagnosis.”28
In their cautionary tale, the authors highlight the complexity of
improving safety in health care, and urge use of evidence grounded in
scientific method, need for engaging end users in measure development,
and awareness of potential biases that may corrupt guideline development.
In addition to reviewing the definitions and characteristics of HRO, it is
useful to understand the challenges and opportunities of applying this
theory to health care. While there are many examples of high-functioning
systems in health care, several challenges remain. In comparison to other
industries, adoption of recommended standards in medicine is sometimes
delayed and inadequate.29,30 In many instances, there is a lack of clear
frameworks with which to measure our progress. Scorecards are not always
sufficient.11 Valid, target-specific data may be lacking,11 and data
acquisition in general suffers from lack of standardization and coordination
of databases (even within a single institution). Some of the answers are
simply unknown. How can we measure our progress with 30-day
postoperative mortality when there is inadequate detail about global
perioperative 30-day mortality and no risk-adjusted 30-day mortality data?
In addition to these issues, there are several cultural issues in medicine
that may be at odds with HRO theory. Our industry has historically been
geared toward physician autonomy. In some instances, this can lead to
practices that are not data driven and run counter to standardized process
development. The hierarchy in medicine, especially between physicians and
nurses, can impede proper coordination required for an HRO.31 This often
leads to communication problems and failure of frontline workers to speak
up and participate.
While studying high reliability in other types of industries has proven
useful, some argue for caution when extrapolating HRO theory to health
care. There is high variability in patients, within teams, and across a single
system.32 Our challenge is to take these ideas and refine concepts that are
relevant to health care. Having defined some important concepts, it is useful
to consider the path that an organization may take as they strive to improve
clinical care and patient safety. The first step is to define the goals. Clearly,
one goal should be to eliminate medical errors. These are the most
conspicuous aspects of poor patient outcome and can lead to morbidity and
mortality. It is equally important to look at more global outcomes. Medical
errors do not always lead to adverse outcomes, and adverse outcomes are
not always the result of medical errors; indeed, clear-cut errors cause only a
minority of poor outcomes. A true HRO should both prevent errors and
minimize preventable adverse outcomes. The second step is to define
metrics. What are we trying to accomplish, what should we measure, how
are we going to measure it, how will we quantify results, and how will these
data be used to improve outcomes? After defining metrics, an organization
should then develop tools and protocols aimed at improving outcomes.
Unfortunately, for some, this is the end of the operation, when in actuality
what follows is the most important and most difficult part of the process,
the implementation. This is where all levels of the organization, from
leadership to frontline workers, must be engaged. Once processes have been
implemented, then proper follow-up, reevaluation, and adjustments are
required.
There is much to be learned from high-risk organizational theory as
well as other doctrines such as human factors, teamwork philosophy,31 and
normal accident theory.33 In addition to understanding these ideas, we must
work to identify particular concepts that should be applied to health care as
well as understanding potential negative consequences of their application.
All of these steps as well as addressing cultural or other systemic issues are
essential components of achieving high reliability status in health care.
KEY POINTS
High reliability organizations maintain a strong culture of safety,
what has been termed a collective mindfulness.
High reliability organizations pay close to operations and how
these systems can affect outcomes.
Engaging the entire organization, from senior leadership to
frontline workers, is crucial to achieving high reliability status.
Health care is a complex system whose parts are tightly coupled
making it vulnerable to “normal accidents.”
Human factors theory is not about eliminating human error or
teaching people to modify their behavior, but designing systems
that are resilient to unanticipated events.
The health care industry must be cognizant of potential
unintended consequences of its efforts.
In addition to understanding organizational theory, the health care
must address cultural and other barriers to achieving high
reliability status.

4 Quality Improvement and Patient
Safety Tools
Binjon Sriratana and Anshuman Sharma
CLINICAL VIGNETTE
In a large university hospital, the cancellation rate for patients
scheduled to undergo elective surgical or diagnostic procedures
requiring anesthesia remains more than 1.8%. A preoperative
assessment and planning clinic is established to optimize preoperative
care and reduce the unwarranted cancellation rate. Using an electronic
patient boarding system, waiting times were observed to be increasing.
This has resulted in a rise in patient complaints and frustration of
nursing staff. The administration wants to decrease the preoperative
assessment clinic waiting times (defined as the time from patient's
scheduled appointment to MD/advanced practice nurse [APN]
encounter) in order to decrease overtime hours and complaints and
increase clinic visits.
What are important components to consider before making a
change to the system?
What tools can the team use to develop and monitor an
improvement project?
INTRODUCTION
Current health care delivery is clearly the best and the most complex the
world has ever seen. With the help of modern medicine, substantial gains
have been made in increasing the life expectancy and in improving the
quality of life for millions of patients. Yet, it frequently falls short of its
theoretical potential. The Institute of Medicine defines quality as “the
degree to which health services for individuals and populations increase the
likelihood of desired health outcomes and consistent with current
professional knowledge.”1 Quality problems on health care delivery are
reflected in the wide variation in the use of medical treatment: underuse of
some and overuse of others, and an unacceptable high number of
preventable errors. This significant “quality gap” between what is achieved
and what can be achieved has been highlighted in medical literature for
more than two decades.1,2 As a result of increasing national attention,
patient safety concerns and quality improvement (QI) methods are being
integrated in routine medical practices and medical education.
This chapter aims to introduce medical professionals to QI and patient
safety tools that are frequently used in health care settings. Most of these
tools have been adopted from other high-risk industries. Further references
are provided at the end of the chapter for in-depth review.
SCIENCE 
OF 
QUALITY
IMPROVEMENT
“Every system is perfectly designed to achieve the results it achieves.” This
fundamental model of health care delivery was conceptualized by Avedis
Donabedian MD in 1966.2 Improvements in individual performances can
produce at best a minor, and often nonsustainable, improvement in the
output. This shift in focus, from the performance and efforts of an
individual health care worker to the system and process-based model of
care delivery, is relatively new in modern medicine.
In this chapter, we first describe the basic concepts in the science of QI,
followed by commonly used QI tools.
The science of improvement is concerned with how availability of new
knowledge of a specific subject matter is applied in routine clinical
situations. The fundamental principles of QI are iteration and critical
thinking—generating the hypothesis, testing the hypothesis, and, once the
hypothesis is confirmed, or negated, executing the cycle again to extend the
knowledge further. W. Edward Deming first applied these principles to QI
and developed the “System of Profound Knowledge” necessary for making
changes that will result in improvement.3 The word “profound” stresses that
deep insightful knowledge of the existing system; an understanding of
theories of systems, variance, and human psychology is necessary for
making improvement changes.
Appreciating the System
The health care delivery model is a complex, tightly coupled, and
dependent system. For example, a detailed preoperative evaluation of a
patient requires good communication across the offices of the surgeon,
primary care physician, internists, specialist, and anesthesiologist.
Depending upon the patient's condition, additional preoperative diagnostic
tests may need to be ordered, results of which influence anesthetic plan or
may result in the modification, delay, or cancellation of the surgery.
Introduction of any change in this complex, highly interdependent, and
tightly coupled system has ramifications across many departments.
Therefore, it is essential that QI teams develop a deep understanding of the
existing system. There are a number of tools that can be used to understand
how the current process works. This “mapping” of any process can be
achieved by using either of the following tools:
Flow diagrams: A flow diagram or flowchart is a graphic display of the
series of activities that constitutes a process. These charts are
extremely helpful in defining the scope of the improvement project,
identifying bottlenecks, and understanding relationships between the
division and key decision points that affect the final outcome.
Value stream mapping: Value stream mapping is a variation of
flowchart that displays process flow along with the controls for
information flow. These types of charts are commonly used in lean
improvement projects.
Causal loop diagram: Causal loop diagram is used to identify and
graphically represent dependency between variables and the dynamic
nature of the relationship. More complex methods such as dynamic
simulation and linkage of processes may be required to develop
understanding highly complex processes that cut across many
departments or organization.
After developing a thorough understanding of the process system, one
must define the boundaries for the QI project. A too ambitious change often
results in failure. Additional information is often needed including the
opinions of frontline workers.
Understanding Variation
Variance is expected in all processes. For example, time taken to perform a
preoperative evaluation in the clinic varies between patients and between
health care providers. These differences may stem from differences in the
patient's medical history, preoperative tests needed, and their social
background. This type of variation is called common cause variation. On
the other hand, special cause variation stems from reasons that are not
integral to the process. For example, if one of the physicians orders a
preoperative echo for every patient over sixty as part of the preoperative
testing where as others do not, his visit timings may be high because of this
“special cause” variation. Statistical theory developed by Walter A.
Shewhart highlights the need to identify the specific cause of variation in
any output.4 Special cause variations are easier to fix but often result in a
marginal improvement. On the other hand, to reduce common cause
variation, the entire process or system revamp is required. A common
mistake made during improvement projects is to assign special cause
variance to common cause and thus missing an opportunity to improve the
existing system. Control or Shewhart charts are types of run charts (see
below) that display quality indicators or summary in a run order (usually
over time) and are frequently used to differentiate common cause variation
from the special cause variation.
Building Knowledge
Making changes and measuring the results is the basis of all improvement
efforts. Lessons learned from measuring effects of the introduction of a
small change can form the knowledge required for the next cycle. By
repeating these cycles, also known as Plan, Do, Study, Act (PDSA) cycles,
one can eventually develop a theory that can reliably predict change. This
method of developing new knowledge differs from classic randomized
controlled trial (RCT) model of developing new knowledge. The knowledge
developed by RCT trials heavy great internal validity but may lack
implications for day-to-day clinical care. On the other, knowledge
developed by improvement projects is often relevant to a local system.
The Human Side of Change
Change is often difficult, and individuals react differently to the proposed
change. Understanding human behavior and human interactions is a
necessary skill that is required for successful implementation of any QI
project. Human motivations must be considered while selecting members of
the improvement team. Team leaders also must understand the need to
communicate advantages of the proposed change in a clear manner to all
those who will be affected both up- and downstream the process flow. Be
sure that the team members have in-depth knowledge of the process, and
usually, this knowledge resides with the frontline workers or those who
work at the sharp end of spear. Management's role is limited to allocate all
the resources necessary for the QI team to accomplish the set goal and
facilitate with implementation of the change. For our scenario, an ideal
team would include of the anesthesiologist, nursing manager, administrative
manager, resident physicians, APNs, and nurses. It may also be necessary to
include other individuals to assist the improvement process for data
collection, interpretation, and analysis of the data.
TOOLS 
FOR 
DEVELOPING 
A
cHANGE: 
THE 
MODEL 
FOR
IMPROVEMENT
A common framework for achieving improvement is called the Model for
Improvement.5 This model consists of asking three basic questions and is
combined with testing an intervention or a new innovation using a PDSA
cycle (see Fig. 4-1). These three questions are:
Figure 4-1 The model for improvement and PDSA cycle. (Adapted from
Langley GJ, Moen RD, Nolan KM, et al. The Improvement Guide: A
Practical Approach to Enhancing Organizational Performance, Epub
Edition. 2nd ed. San Francisco, CA: John Wiley & Sons Inc; 2009.)
What Are We Trying to Accomplish?
This question sets the aim or goals for the QI project. Aims or the charter of
the project should be in the form of a statement. It must be clear and
specific as to what needs to be changed or improved. It should be time
specific and measurable. It may also define the specific population of
patients or other systems that will be affected. The following is an example
of an effective aim statement for our vignette:
Over the next 6 months we will reduce by 30% the average waiting
time, defined as the number of minutes between patient's scheduled
appointment and the actual time of encounter with an MD/APN. The aim
should specify the system to be improved (the flow of patients), its specific
patient population (surgical candidates), its measurable goal (30% decrease
in patient waiting time), and specific time frame (within the next 6 months).
In addition, the goals have to be realistic. Benchmarking with other
successful organizations is one such method that helps the team to avoid
utopian goals.
How Will We Know that Change Is an
Improvement?
In a complex, tightly coupled system such as a preanesthesia clinic,
measurement is a critical part of testing and implementing changes.
Measures tell a team whether or not the changes actually yield
improvement. A team must develop a set of rigorous, unbiased, quantitative
indicators that everyone agrees as an improvement. Donabedian proposed
measuring quality of health care by structural, process, and outcome
measures.2 To clarify the perspective of Donabedian, the following are brief
descriptions of those measures:
Structural measures focus on accessibility, availability, and quality of
the hospital resources, for example, the number of APNs per 100
patients in a clinic.
Process measures gauge whether an activity has been accomplished
efficiently and reliably. Waiting times in a clinic and frequency of on-
time administration of preoperative antibiotic are examples of process
measures.
Outcome measures gauge the impact of treatment on the values of
patients, their health, and well-being. Postoperative mortality in 30
days and incidence of severe pain after knee replacement surgery are
two such examples of outcome measures. These days, financial and
cost measures are commonly being included as outcome measure in
most QI projects.
Balancing measures ensure that improvements made to one system do
not sacrifice quality of other measure. In other words, these are related
measures that must be maintained or improved but not compromised
while implementing the proposed change. For example, surgical
cancellation rate could be used as a balancing measure for increased
efficiency in the preoperative clinic.
Keep in mind a simple change may not be limited to just one measure.
For our vignette, many measures can be considered: minutes of waiting,
number of patient complaints, number of patient walkouts (leaving before
seeing a doctor), number of overtime hours, number of medical errors
(balancing measure), and frequency of surgical cancellations per month due
to inadequate preoperative evaluation. These indicators, many of them
surrogate for efficient and reliable patient care, are recorded before and
after the change is implemented.
What Change Can We Make that Will
Result in Improvement?
Change concepts are general notions or approaches found to be useful in
developing specific ideas for change that result in improvement. Certain
changes are needed to optimize the existing systems and are known as
reactive changes. One can say the removing special cause variance is a
reactive change. However, if whole new level of performance is required of
the system, fundamental changes are needed to revamp the entire system.
These changes are aimed to remove or reduce the common cause variance
in the system. As mentioned above, making reactive changes to an existing
system is easier, but improvement gains are relatively modest. Ideas for
developing a fundamental change are readily available and come from the
insights of those who have the “profound knowledge” of the system. One
simple method is to observe other organizations that have accomplished
similar changes. In more complex systems, developing change ideas are
complicated and require organized approach. In the last few decades, many
tools have been developed to assist with improvement projected related to
health care industry. Some of these tools are mentioned below:
Quality function deployment helps with organizing relationships
between process measures and the key factors that affect the
performance of these measures. This method provides an efficient way
to answer both second and third questions of the model of
improvement.
Pareto Charts: “Pareto principle,” commonly called the 80:20 rule,
states that relatively few factors are responsible for a majority of the
effects. Pareto charts are bar charts that organize various contributing
factors according to the magnitude of their effect. This organizing
helps identify the “vital few” causes that warrant urgent and most
attention.
Failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA): QI projects will always
encounter obstacles, but obstacles can be avoided or manageable if
they are planned in advance. The FMEA is one such proactive system
that was originally developed by the US military.6,7 This tool evaluates
the processes, identifies the potential failures, and develops methods to
prevent potential failures from happening. The Joint Commission has
required accredited health care organizations to develop similar risk
management strategies.8 FMEA reviews the steps of the process to
identify how and where it might fail (see Fig. 4-2). For our vignette,
the preoperative clinic staff can view all of the steps involved in the
patient discharge process. One important step to this process is
obtaining preoperative labs. Key components to the FMEA are
answering these three questions:
1. What could go wrong? (Failure modes) The nurses cannot draw
patient blood.2. Why would the failure happen? (Failure causes)
Patient has a difficult venous access. Patient has a port and nurse may
not be trained to access the port, provider is inexperienced, or patient
refuses.3. What would be the consequence of each failure? (Failure
effects) Delay in clinic discharge and boarding next patient, longer
patient waiting time and patient dissatisfaction, and potential delay of
surgery.
Figure 4-2 Failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) tool. Each step of a
process is analyzed to determine the likelihood and severity of failure, and
action plans are created to reduce occurrences of failure. Adapted from the
Institute for Healthcare Improvement FMEA Tool. (Available on
www.IHI.org)
For each failure mode, a numeric value also known as the Risk Priority
Number (RPN) is assigned. This is a subjective value ranging from 1 to 10,
meaning “very unlikely” to “very likely to occur,” respectively. First, use a
number to answer the three following questions:
1. How likely will this failure mode occur? (Likelihood of occurrence)
2. How likely will this failure be detected in the failure mode occurs?
(Likelihood of detection)
3. What is the severity if this failure were to occur? (Severity)
Next, multiply the three values to calculate the RPN. Compare the
RPNs of various failure modes. Those with the lowest number are least
likely to occur and/or effect the overall process. However, those with the
higher scores create greater burden; therefore, the team should seek actions
to reduce the occurrence of failure. The following action plan was
developed for a difficult venous access patient: senior nursing staff safely
attempts venipuncture on bilateral upper extremities. If not successful, a
physician attempts bilateral upper and lower extremities. If still not
successful, a physician attempts arterial puncture. Also, consider referring
the patient for the placement of preoperative peripherally inserted central
catheter (PICC), and make a note in the OR schedule that patient is a
difficult access patient.
Health failure mode and effect analysis (HFMEA) is another tool
developed by VA's National Center for Patient Safety and is based on
FMEA. This method uses hazard analysis by working though the decision
tree analysis.8
Cause and effect diagram: Also known as fishbone or Ishikawa
diagram, it is used to collect, organize, and summarize current knowledge
of potential variation. See Figure 4-3. One starts by writing down the
problem in a box to the right of an arrow. Identify at least four or more
major factors that the team has identified as contributing factors, and add
these in the branches of the main arrow. Further subcategories of factors
influencing these main factors can be recorded after discussion with the
team members. These diagrams can then function as working document that
should be updated throughout the project.
Figure 4-3 Ishikawa or Fishbone diagram: Major factors and variables are
shown how they influence the wait time in the clinic.
Driver diagrams: These are structured logic charts with three or more
levels and are commonly used to organize theories and ideas about what
changes can be made in order to make an improvement. At minimum, a
driver diagram would include a goal, high-level factors, or primary drivers
that need to be changed in order to achieve the stated goal and, finally,
specific activities that will be needed to make the changes. For more
complex projects, number of levels can be expanded.
A meeting was held among the newly assembled team. Feedback from
nursing staff was collected using a survey instrument. Ishikawa fishbone
diagram was used to identify the major factors that impact patient wait time.
It was observed that there was a large variation in how nurses and
physicians entered patients' history and physical examination data into
electronic medical records. This variance in practice often resulted in
inconsistent preoperative workups resulting in higher-than-expected
cancellation rate for elective surgeries. A new standardized preoperative
form that reduced free text entry was designed and implemented. The team
also discovered that the busiest days of the week were Monday afternoons,
whereas the number of patients seen on Thursday mornings was
consistently low. This coincided to the days with longest and shortest
average waiting times of 45 and 25 minutes, respectively. The team
proposed a change to staff another resident physician on Mondays.
TESTING THE CHANGE: PLAN,
DO, STUDY, ACT CYCLE OR PDSA
CYCLE
The PDSA cycles are used to turn the ideas, developed by answering the
three abovementioned questions, into concrete actions. The PDSA cycle is
an effective tool that provides detailed steps in testing changes and
promotes analytical thinking. The PDSA cycle, initially developed by
Deming and later modified by Shewart, has been used by many
organizations including health care organization to test and implement
change and improve patient care.4,9 The defining principle of the PDSA
cycle is to first test a change in order to provide proof that the proposed
change (or a series of changes) will actually result in improvement. This
may also help to predict how much improvement can be expected. If a
change results in improvement, then it can be implemented on a larger
scale. Other option is to extend the tests to gradually include larger samples
until you are confident that the change should be more widely adopted.
Therefore, it is best to test on a small scale to avoid widespread
complications.
As the name suggests, there are four steps in the PDSA cycle:
a. The Planning phase involves answering questions about the change,
making predictions about the change, and planning for collecting
relevant data. Planning is necessary as it helps team members stay
on the same page, prevent hindsight bias, and with designating the
responsibilities of team members.
b. During the Do phase, testing the change is begun on a small scale
and observations are made in the after-intervention phase. The team
also documents other challenges met by the team.
c. During the Study phase, collected data before and after the
intervention are compared and other results are studied.
d. During the Act phase, based on the information collected, the team
makes a decision about adopting, modifying, or completely
abandoning the new change plan. If the plan is modified, another
PDSA cycle is initiated.
The PDSA cycle is used sequentially to test changes. Knowledge gained
in step “c” and modifications developed in step “d” can be used to develop
new cycles. New cycles can also be used to test changes on a larger scale.
Once a change is proven to result in improvement, then it should be
implemented. As stated before, improvement requires multiple changes.
Multiple changes therefore will require multiple tests and PDSA cycles.
After 1 month of introducing new preoperative anesthesia evaluation
form and making the changes in the staffing model, significant
improvement was noticed in the average time needed to see one patient
through the clinic from 78 to 63 minutes. This corresponded with Monday
waiting times decreasing from 45 to 39 minutes. The number of overtime
hours has decreased by 30%, and the number of complaints has decreased
by 40%. Because of the improved patient flow, Thursday clinic times also
decreased from 30 to 26 minutes. The team concluded that new
preoperative evaluation form and adding a physician on Mondays have
resulted in an improvement to the preoperative and assessment clinic. The
team also learned from resident physicians that for consistent preoperative
testing, guidelines and recommendations from the American Society of
Anesthesiology should be posted in the physician offices. Accurate home
medication list is another area for improvement identified by the team.
Accurate documentation of patient medications is expected to improve
preoperative administration of β-blockers and possibly reduce the incidence
of postoperative myocardial infarction. The team therefore proposed to
make and test these change in a new series of PDSA cycles. The new cycle
will need to engage nursing staff from the preoperative surgery area and
anesthesiologists that will assist with collection of data regarding
postoperative myocardial infarction.
TOOLS FOR MONITORING DATA
There are many tools that provide an easy practical way of tracking and
graphically displaying the data collected prior to and after the
implementation of the change.
Run Charts
Run charts provide a simple and practical way of tracking and displaying
data generated from your changes10 (see Fig. 4-4). They are essentially line
graphs—time intervals are plotted along the x-axis and a measure is plotted
along the y-axis. Median and mean values can also be visualized on the
chart. For measures and outcomes that happen infrequently, the number of
days between two events is a better way to graph the run chart. Annotations
can be placed within the chart to show how a change affects the measure
and what variables were noted throughout the process. The goal line (at the
measured value you aim to achieve) can also be displayed on the chart to
better visualize how close the team is to achieving their goal (or aim). Since
there are multiple measures used when testing a single change, multiple run
charts are developed. Ideally, these charts will prove your changes are
yielding improvements. On the other hand, if no improvements are
depicted, it can encourage the team that other changes need to be made.
Figure 4-4 Example of a simple run chart. Rate of on-time administration
of preoperative antibiotics in patients undergoing total knee replacement
surgery. Rates were lowest in July and August of 2012. This may be a case
of special cause variation introduced into the system and need further
investigation.
Control Charts
A more sophisticated tool is the control chart. As mentioned above, control
charts are primarily used as a surveillance tool to monitor the “status quo”
of a system. It is used to study how a process changes over time (i.e., how
waiting room times have varied over the past couple years). In other words,
the primary purpose of the control charts is to display the variance in the
existing system and helps in distinguishing between common cause and
special cause variations. In commonly displayed control charts, the center
line is the mean (or any other measure of central tendency) value of the
quality measurement, whereas upper and lower control limits are usually set
at 3 standard deviations (σ) above and below the center line, respectively. If
the process is in control, or at status quo, 99.7% of all the points will fall
between the control limits (upper and lower). If points are found outside the
control limits, then it is statistically unlikely due to common cause
variation.
There are many types of control charts, and their use depends on the
type of data that are being collected and its distribution pattern. For
example, p or np charts are used for categorical data, whereas X chart or X
bar chart is used for continuous data.10
Figure 4-5 is a control chart monitoring our vignettes average waiting
times. Note the points lie within the control limits. This means a complete
revamp of preoperative clinic is the only method of reducing patient wait
time.
Figure 4-5 Control chart of clinic waiting times over the past 11 months
prior to the clinic's improvement project. The upper and lower control limits
are shown. Plot demonstrates common cause variation within the control
limits. A fundamental change in the system is needed to achieve the stated
goal for reducing wait time by 30%.
ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES TO
THE QI PROJECTS
Though PDSA cycles combined with model of improvement are the most
commonly used approach to the improvement projects, many other
roadmaps are available for use. Some of these approaches are developed for
achieving specific aims. For example, lean approach is a systematic
approach to identifying and eliminating waste. Six Sigma approach on the
other hand assists with reduction in the manufacturing defects. FOCUS-
PDCA is another modification of model of improvement where three
questions are replaced by Find, Organize, Clarify, Understand, and Select
the process improvement. This is followed by the abovementioned PDCA
cycle. It is recommended that organization chose one consistent framework
for improvement.
SUMMARY
QI is a complex task. However, QI teams are best suited to handle
improvement projects only if they develop a good understanding of the
process and involve frontline worker in developing the change. A top–down
approach usually is met with resistance and produces inconsistent, short-
lived benefits if any. Our vignette's improvement team was successful in
achieving their goal of decreasing their preoperative clinic waiting times.
The team members, in an organized fashion, analyzed the problem using
various diagrams and methods of data collection. They made repeated
changes, test, and analyzed them using the Model for Improvement and
PDSA cycle. They also carefully monitored for improvement using run and
control charts. Finally, they were able to identify other improvement ideas
that will be tested in the next improvement cycle. Lesson learned from these
PDSA cycles may also be used to improve process and patient care in other
similar clinics across the hospital.
KEY POINTS
The three parts of the Model for Improvement are as follows:
What are we trying to accomplish? How will we know that
change is an improvement? What change can we make that will
result in improvement?
PDSA cycle stands for “Plan, Do, Study, Act.”

CLINICAL VIGNETTE
An 85-year-old man was scheduled to have cataract surgery performed in an
outpatient setting. The surgeon had reviewed the patient's preoperative
measurements of the eye to select the appropriate lens implant to place after
the cataract was removed the night prior to the surgery. On the morning of
the surgery, the surgeon became aware that the lens he had selected was out
of stock at the surgical facility. He selected a lens that would give a similar
refractive outcome for the patient, but it was not his ideal choice. It was
later determined that the logistics staff in charge of reordering intraocular
lens was bundling lens orders rather than sending in a more timely fashion.
In the end, the patient suffered no harm.
What methodologies can we use to improve systems in health care that
ensure patient safety?
How can we eliminate waste in health care?
How can Six Sigma and Lean improve quality?
INTRODUCTION
With the increasing cost and growing demand for health care, hospitals,
practices, and ancillary services are in need of solutions to both reduce cost
and provide higher-quality service with existing resources. Two major
models for quality improvement are utilized in health care to identify
sustainable solutions: Six Sigma and Lean.
The fundamental goal of Six Sigma is to continuously improve business
operations. Originally developed in the 1980s by Motorola, numerous
companies started adopting Six Sigma strategies in the 1990s, delivering
considerable benefits to operating income. In the 2000s, many authors also
suggested Six Sigma applicability to health care.1 Over the past several
years, numerous reports have illustrated the implementation of Six Sigma
strategies in multiple health care settings, including some beneficial aspects
and some necessary modifications for the health care sector.
Lean is a philosophy accompanied by a varied set of tools that allows
an organization to focus on the value it creates for the customer and
eliminate wasted resources in its production. The system, which was born
and refined in the automobile manufacturing world with Toyota, carries a
lot of manufacturing terminology. Its principles and tools, however, can be
useful in the design, implementation, and continued execution of all aspects
of patient care.
This chapter focuses on these two methods of quality improvement by
outlining their key concepts and tools to achieve quality improvement and
provide some practical applications to the health care industry (see Fig. 5-
1).

SIX SIGMA
Methods in Six Sigma
The term sigma, as defined by statisticians, refers to the standard deviation
from the mean. In manufacturing and production, a multiple of sigma is
used to refer to the amount of defects that are likely to occur in a production
process.2 A widely accepted numerical value is that a Six Sigma process
only has 3.4 defects per 1 million opportunities. While the practical
application of Six Sigma does not necessitate this statistical occurrence in
every process, the use of the term symbolizes the pursuit of significant
reduction in the possibility of errors.
The reasoning behind this is straightforward—defects cause an increase
in costs. A systematic approach to reducing the occurrence of defects
therefore reduces costs overall.
There are two primary project methods used in Six Sigma:
1. DMAIC for established processes (see Fig. 5-1) a. Define, Measure,
Analyze, Improve, and Control 2. DMADV for new processes a.
Define, Measure, Analyze, Design, and Verify
A Six Sigma project begins by defining and implementing relevant
metrics, which is referred to as the critical to quality (CTQ) characteristics.3
Then, following the appropriate project methodology above, project leaders
guide the execution of a quality improvement project.
Applications of Six Sigma to Health Care
The overall process of Six Sigma is quite applicable to health care, though
the nature of the industry and delivery of health care require appropriate
adaptations. Generally, four metrics in health care define a system's
performance and serve as CTQs for a health care project4:
Service level—for example, wait time, service time, and access to care
Service cost—for example, cost per unit of service and labor
productivity
Customer satisfaction—patient and family satisfaction and referring
physician satisfaction
Clinical excellence—for example, reduction of infection rates
contracted in a hospital and compliance with prescription guidelines
A key concept in translating Six Sigma principles to health care is
recognizing that customers are not necessarily patients but can be any
person impacted during a particular process. All customers rarely
experience the average performance of a metric; instead, they tend to
experience the variability.4 The Six Sigma method attempts to reduce the
variability-induced “defect” even if the average performance of a metric is
good.
One of the factors that has led to slow adaptation of Six Sigma in health
care stems from the perceived discrepancy between an automated
manufacturing process and the inherently social interaction of health care,
that is, health care is driven by humans.4 Human variability is often more
subtle and variable, leading to difficulty identifying causes of process
failures. Multiple reports show that successful implementation of Six Sigma
initiative in health care requires a concurrent cultural strategy shift and
sound operational strategies to implement change.4
DMAIC 
(Define, 
Measure, 
Analyze,
Improve, and Control)
For a Six Sigma project following the DMAIC method, once the CTQ is
identified, the customer voice needs to be translated into a measurable
response variable. For example, a quantifiable clinical excellence variable
may be hospital return rate or radiology report time. Next, measurement of
the process capability for the appropriate CTQ is performed, yielding a
defects per million opportunities (DPMO) number.4
In the analyze phase, the Six Sigma team identifies the causal factors
likely to have most impact on the previously identified and measured
response variable. Then, these factors are categorized as controllable or
uncontrollable depending on their contribution to the response variable.4
Even if a response rate has an acceptable average, if the variability leads to
a high DPMO, factors must be identified that lead to this greater variability,
as that is the cause of the deficient metric. Controllable factors allow
implementation of strategies to directly control the causal factor.
Uncontrollable factors necessitate the design of a new process to withstand
the variability.4
Following the DMAIC protocol, the next phases are improvement and
control. These are felt to be most challenging in health care. Organization
structure can inhibit process-oriented thinking, and without the necessary
oversight and infrastructure, the impetus for change can be limited.4 The
control phase necessitates behavioral changes and translation of project
successes in isolated settings to other applicable venues, as the multitude of
units and disciplines within health care must function as a cohesive unit.
DMADV 
(Define, 
Measure, 
Analyze,
Design, and Verify)
As illustrated above, the DMAIC approach in Six Sigma aims to improve
processes that are prone to error due to inherent variability. However, health
care institutions also require large changes that cannot come about simply
through improvement of existing systems. In these cases, new processes
need to be designed altogether. The threshold occurs as optimization is
achieved in existing systems, but benefits from those changes plateau. At
approximately 4.8 sigma, companies can hit a wall and change is required
to achieve further gains.5 In health care, this wall is felt to occur at earlier
levels due to the multitude of old systems and structures in place.4
This process is represented by the acronym DMADV (Define, Measure,
Analyze, Design, and Verify). A design process in this context includes
iteratively breaking down system design requirement into subsystem
requirements, in order to properly design a process the first time.4 For
example, staffing needs, reward systems, communication requirements, and
information technology needs would be iteratively specified and designed
during the process.
Determining Readiness for DMADV
One of the crucial requirements for DMADV projects is to first identify if
an organization is ready for these large-scale projects. Institutions with
unstable operations and service delivery processes first need to stabilize and
optimize these processes through dedicated DMAIC projects. Once this
optimization occurs, organizations will always reach the aforementioned
“wall.”4 Customer expectations increase and existing legacy systems limit
further improvements.
Then, to proceed with DMADV design projects, the following factors
need to be considered:
What is the effectiveness of the current process?
Is the goal to decrease variability alone or does the entire mean result
of a process need to change?
What are the barriers to change of the current system, including
information technology (IT) requirements?
What upcoming changes are being planned already, such as expansion
of facilities, new therapies, and new governmental requirements?
If the above settings seem to necessitate a new design process, a
DMADV process can be pursued.4
The DMADV Process
The defining and measurement phases of the DMADV process parallel
those of the DMAIC process. However, the goal is to predict the
performance of the new product or service.4
An important tool that can facilitate this process is referred to as quality
function deployment (QFD).4 In QFD, each response variable is plotted
against system requirements, with weight given to each response variable
by perceived priority. The ability of those system requirements to facilitate
change in each response variable is then identified and prioritized. A Pareto
analysis can then be utilized to rank each system requirement by its ability
to influence the highest priority response variables. It is important to do this
measurement and analysis with a focus on the voice of the customer data.4
A successful execution of the analysis phase then identifies subsystem
requirements that will translate into quantifiable result variable
improvements.
The design phase then relies upon this mathematical derivation of
subsystem requirements to properly correlate with customer satisfaction
based on the QFD. This is referred to as capability forecasting.
The validation phase then measures the actual performance of a
subsystem process against the predicted performance, as measured by
customer satisfaction.4 While this system may be more straightforward in
manufacturing, the ability to test each subsystem in a health care setting
may not be feasible. Inherent in this process is targeted changes in
recruitment, 
staff 
development, 
communication, 
and 
information
technology.4
Implementation of Six Sigma
Successful implementation of Six Sigma in a large organization is felt to be
contingent on implementation of numerous operational strategies outside of
Six Sigma. In addition, the system relies on a unique managerial structure
by defining quality management professionals in an organization.6
Specifically, these include the following:
Executive leadership—CEO and other top management that can
oversee continuous quality improvement
Champions—Oversee Six Sigma implementation throughout the
organization
Master Black Belts—Devote 100% of time to Six Sigma. Roles
include statistical analysis, assisting champions, and overseeing Black
Belts.
Black Belts—Lead a team on a project and mentor Green and Yellow
Belts
Green and Yellow Belts—A trained member who participates fully in
the projects, including data management and statistical analysis
While the above roles have evolved with time and organization, the
fundamental principle of strict organization and commitment to the Six
Sigma initiative is integral to success of the projects within the
organization.7
LEAN
The Philosophy of Lean
The foundation of all Lean thinking is best summarized by Taiichi Ohno, an
industrial engineer considered to be the father of the Toyota Production
System8:
“The basis of the Toyota Production System is the absolute elimination of
waste.”
Lean's goal is to identify those aspects of a product or service that
provide value to the customer, define the processes that produce this value,
and eliminate the rest. Anything that does not directly contribute to the
creation of value should be eliminated.
Before eliminating waste, you must identify “value.” In Lean, for an
action to be value adding, it must fulfill the following three criteria8:
1. The customer is willing to pay for it.
2. The action must transform the form, fit, or function of the product.
3. The action must be done correctly the first time.
If any aspect of an action does not meet these criteria, it is considered
waste and should be eliminated.
Lean defines three different types of waste (see Table 5-1).8 Most
prominent is “muda,” meaning non–value-adding work. Two types of muda
exist. Type I muda is work that does not add value but is necessary at the
current time and with the current technology to create value. For example,
filling out a medical reconciliation for a patient admitted to the hospital
adds no direct value from the patient perspective but is necessary as a
patient safety tool. Type II is work that does not add value and is not
necessary to create value. This type of muda could be illustrated by time
spent by staff looking for equipment that is not stored properly or in a
sensible location. The tools of Lean focus on identifying and eliminating
type II muda.
TABLE 
5-1 
Types 
of 
Lean 
Waste
Within muda, there are seven original (and several subsequently added)
categories.9 Knowledge of these categories allows you to look at the
process from many different perspectives to identify and eliminate waste.
The original seven muda can be remembered by the mnemonic TIM
WOOD.
Transport—the process of relocating resources Inventory—having more
than is needed for the task at hand Motion—added movement of
resources that does not add value Waiting—wasted time when people,
information, or resources are not readily available Overproduction—
redundant or duplicate work Overprocessing—the wrong tool or
sequence of step being used for the task Defects—work that contains
errors or lacks value
Additional types of muda include unmet customer demands and unused
human talent.10 The two other types of waste, mura and muri, may not be as
obvious but can provide insight into creating better processes. Mura,
“unevenness,” is a waste that might be better defined as “inconsistency.” If
a process has not been standardized or the people implementing it have not
been appropriately trained, the process will inconsistently perform—both
with respect to time it takes to complete and quality of the outcome. This
“unevenness” of the process directly leads to muda.
Muri, “overburdened,” is the waste that occurs when a greater level of
performance from a process is asked for than it can handle without taking
shortcuts and informally modifying decision criteria. This overburdened
state directly leads to inconsistency in results for the process (mura), which
directly causes non–value-adding work (muda). As an example, when
creating a new process for IV placement, if not all of the nurses are trained
in the new process (muri), tracking of IV placement outcomes will show
great variance in the results (mura). The variability will appear in real time
as the muda of defects (poor IV placements), motion (nurse going to get
more supplies for alternative attempts), and waiting (needing to get another
nurse to help).
Lean has a number of concepts and tools to help identify value and
waste and begin the elimination process. Most central to Lean is the concept
of “kaizen,” continuous improvement.8 Kaizen is the process of
continuously making incremental improvements in processes, consistently
eliminating waste, and striving toward sculpting a “perfect” process. Each
member of an organization, from the CEO to the janitor, is expected to
contribute to kaizen, seeking out and finding new innovative way to
eliminate waste.
Pull Systems in Lean
Another center concept of Lean is creating “Pull” systems,8,11 also known
as “just-in-time.” Pull is a Lean strategy inherently structured to eliminate
waste, especially the muda of overproduction. In a batch-and-queue
manufacturing process, managers will attempt to predict the future demand
of a product. In this “PUSH” system, the amount of product expected to
meet demand is produced and stored in inventory. As demand occurs, the
product is pulled from inventory and delivered to the customer. Due to the
inherent difficulties of predicting future demand, even with historical
trends, they are likely to miss the true mark. If demand is lower than
expected, a great deal of overproduction muda will occur. If demand is
higher than expected, unless the manufacturing process has been “leaned”
out, they will lose customers to the long wait time.
In a Pull system, no product is produced until signaled from a
downstream demand. For example, a customer orders a loaf of bread at a
bakery. That downstream demand signals to the baker to make a loaf of
bread. To make the bread, the baker uses flour, milk, and eggs, which
become a signal to the farmer to mill more flour and milk the cows. It is
obvious that a Pull system creates less waste especially in terms of
inventory. However, such a process in a time-sensitive industry may create
long lead times (the time from order to delivery).
In a perfect Lean process, the lead time is short enough to respond in
real time to fluctuations in demand. In reality, a Lean process is not
completely inventory-free but rather has a buffer of intermediate materials
and resources to continue to run while upstream processes have time to
respond to the downstream signaling. The important aspect of a Pull system
is that clear signaling (called kanban11) to upstream processes occurs in real
time and directs them to create the appropriate amount and the appropriate
time. For example, in the clinical vignette at the beginning of the chapter,
most facilities maintain a small consignment of intraocular lenses (usually
2–3) in the most frequently used powers and then the lenses are replaced in
consignment as the lenses are utilized so that the hospital or surgical center
does not need to maintain a large inventory of lenses, which can take
considerable space. Once a lens is used in surgery, the lens sticker from the
case is transmitted to the logistics or ordering department so that
consignment levels can be maintained.
Implementing the Lean Mind-Set
Lean can be used for “quick fixes,” but the gains will be short-lived. True
Lean implementation requires a commitment by all parties or all levels of
an organization. The organization as a whole organism should express
explicitly the goal of “the absolute elimination of waste.” From the
architecture to the accounting department to the operating rooms, all
stakeholders must direct their thoughts and acts toward this goal.
The Lean mind-set in an organization's culture can be seeded and
nurtured through having a number of “kaizen events.”12 While a bit of a
misnomer, a kaizen event formalizes and encapsulates all of the steps
necessary to bring about change. These events introduce the participants to
the philosophy, concepts, and tools of Lean. Also, through having a mix of
people at an event—both people with intimate knowledge of the process
and those inexperienced—it becomes clear that all need to have a hand in
kaizen. In this dynamic, the inexperienced participants are forced to ask a
series of “why” questions.8 (Why do you do it this way? Why does this
need to happen?) These questions force the more experienced to clearly
explain the reason for why things are done and begin to highlight, with each
subsequent why, that there may not be a great reason to perform certain
tasks in certain ways.
While the “5 Why” is one tool used in Lean, there are a wide array of
tools. Each of these tools has been created pragmatically to help solve a
different problem using Lean thinking. One of the major tools used in Lean
is value stream mapping13 (see Fig. 5-2). This tool is widely used to analyze
and design the flow of materials, information, and resources to deliver a
valued outcome. Once a process is mapped out in detail, it becomes clear
where waste is occurring and creates a kaizen opportunity (see Fig. 5-3).

ordering in a hospital-based setting.

ordering in a hospital-based setting after completing kaizen event analysis.
From Manufacturing to Service
As is evident from the terminology of Lean, it developed from
manufacturing.14 With care, these concepts can be transferred to other
industries including health care services.15 When making this transition, it
is important to translate some of the definitions so as not to leave out
important aspects of service. Most notably, identifying value-added aspects
in a patient care experience can be far more difficult than the value-added
components of a static product. While efficiency and speed are king in
manufacturing, certain aspects of patient care should be viewed in the same
light. As a general rule, the “things” of health care (notes, procedures, tests)
should be “leaned” out, but in any aspect involving patient interaction,
value lies in the direct interaction and human connection. This should not
be seen as something to lean out.
Also, in a service industry, certain behaviors can and should be acutely
focused on as a source of value or waste. Behaviors such as cheerfulness,
courtesy, respect, and well dressed should not be overlooked when
planning, implementing, and evaluating processes.
DIFFICULTIES AND LIMITATIONS
OF SIX SIGMA AND LEAN IN
HEALTH CARE
One of the biggest obstacles to implementing sustainable Lean or Six Sigma
process changes is the required support of upper management. In Six
Sigma, both the DMAIC and DMADV processes require appropriate
support of leadership in execution of the process and in its implementation.
For Lean to be continuous, the mind-set must pervade the entire
organization.12,15 Frequently, management believes that for change to
occur, it must happen from a top–down approach. However, waste is most
easily seen at the level at which it is produced. The frontline worker will
recognize the kaizen opportunity long before those not intimately involved
in the process. Mentors from upper levels should aid in the process and
provide resources to help tackle the identified waste.
The rigid nature of Six Sigma or Lean is felt to focus attention more on
methods and tools and not on direct organizational robustness.16 This
emphasis on a model-based approach may hinder practical problem solving
by 
oversimplifying 
complex 
interactions, 
particularly 
in 
the
multidisciplinary approach to health care.
Another criticism of Six Sigma rests on the observation that sometimes,
a “Six Sigma Bureaucracy” can develop within an organization. While the
aim of data-focused approaches is to eliminate bureaucratic decision
making, the emphasis on the Six Sigma format may instead create a
different version of the same problem.16

Six Sigma's goal is to eliminate defects, thereby reducing costs.
DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control) for
established processes.
DMADV (Define, Measure, Analyze, Design, and Verify) for new
processes.
Lean is the elimination of waste from the process of creating
value.
Kaizen, meaning continuous improvement, is the process through
which waste is eliminated.
Lean uses multiple tools, including value stream mapping, to
visualize a process and decide what waste to eliminate.
Both Six Sigma and Lean require the buy-in of upper
management to be properly executed and supported.

6 Accountability and Reporting
Jonas Marschall and Emily Fondahn
CLINICAL VIGNETTE
A 67-year-old woman with coronary artery disease and diabetes mellitus
who was recently diagnosed with endometrial carcinoma is admitted for
removal of her uterus, ovaries, and lymph nodes by a resident gynecologist.
Her home medications include aspirin, which she has taken up to the day of
admission. The patient's family practitioner was aware of the upcoming
surgery but has not paused aspirin 7–10 days before surgery as indicated.
The resident gynecologist forgets to report this fact to the attending
gynecologist who is scheduled to operate on the patient. Aspirin use is not
part of the routine questions upon admission for elective surgery. The
attending gynecologist does not look at the chart before meeting the patient.
The anesthesiologist notices aspirin on the medication list but believes the
attending gynecologist is aware of the patient's medications. The next day,
the surgery is notable for excessive bleeding and takes 30 minutes longer
than usual because of the amount of cauterization required. The attending
gynecologist is acutely aware that the tissue damage that resulted will
increase the patient's risk of developing a wound infection. After the
surgery, he yells at the resident gynecologist and blames him for not
stopping aspirin: “You should have told me and I would have cancelled the
surgery!” The resident gynecologist is devastated for not having caught this
and excuses himself. The patient subsequently develops a postoperative
wound infection.
Is the resident gynecologist responsible, accountable, or to be blamed?
Who is to enforce accountability?
Is this an event that should be reported?
Has this event been used as an opportunity to improve the system?
INTRODUCTION
Few readers of this manual will first skip to the chapter on accountability
and reporting, yet this is one of the most important topics in patient safety
because it provides the framework for setting standards and enforcing
patient safety measures. Hospital staff involved in patient safety and quality
should know a few key concepts to understand the legal implications of
their work. Here are some definitions:
Accountability: An obligation or willingness to accept responsibility or
to account for one's actions, which is closely related to culpability and
liability.
Public reporting: The obligation to disclose data that are relevant for
patient safety to the public, for example, postoperative infection rates,
severe medication errors, or mortality rates of hospitalized patients.
Quality indicator: A measure of medical processes or outcomes that
can be used to determine the quality of health care and serve as a basis
for improvement initiatives.
Regulatory agency: A government agency that has supervisory
capacity over a specific field of human activity.
ACCOUNTABILITY
History
The concept of accountability has long been present in medicine. The
opening declaration of the American Medical Association's (AMA) first
code of ethics states that for a physician, “there is no tribunal, other than his
own conscience, to adjudge penalties for carelessness or neglect” (AMA,
1847, Art. I 1). However, the focus has shifted from the individual
physician's own conscience to the health care system as a whole. The
individualist concept of accountability has guided health care until recently.
Prior to the 19th century, reputation and character largely impacted a
physician's practice, especially given the lack of medical therapeutics. In
the beginning of the 20th century, with scientific advances, a strong
emphasis was placed on medical reform by individuals such as Flexner who
proposed reform and standardization of medical education and Codman
who advocated for surgical and hospital standards.1 Following World War I,
the image of the autonomous physician who is the “captain of the ship”
emerges.
In the 1970s and 1980s, concerns about rising costs of health care lead
to the first “report card” being released by the Health Care Financing
Administration, which contained hospital-specific data on Medicare
mortality rates. Quality measures have become one common method for
reporting accountability.2 In 1998, the ORYX initiative was started by the
Joint Commission (JC), which was the first national program to require
reporting of hospitals on performance measures.3 Starting in 2002,
accredited hospitals were required to report data on core measures, and this
information was made public in 2004.4 Since then, the number of quality
measures endorsed and reported by agencies has skyrocketed. For example,
the National Quality Forum (NQF) now endorses over 600 quality
measures.
Systems Thinking and Accountability
The patient safety movement is based on the assumption that errors occur
when a poorly designed systems allow individuals to make harmful but
potentially preventable errors. By redesigning the system, such errors are
thought to be no longer possible or at least less likely to occur. Bar coding
and computerized physician order entry are examples for systems design.
However, if an error does occur, then someone has to assume responsibility
for it, work toward further improvement, and provide the victim of the error
with a supportive counterpart (who discloses the error and explains to the
patient what measures will be taken next). The entity that is accountable
can either be an individual health care professional or an entire
organization, which are linked to each other in the “systems approach.”
Systems thinking was developed from feedback circles and has, as one of
the premises, the “connectivity of elements.”5 As a consequence, errors can
be considered as reminders that a system requires further modification to
work better.
Individual 
and 
Organizational
Accountability
Can we pursue a work environment where blame has no place but at the
same time expect health care workers to accept responsibility for their
actions and take ownership of them? How easy is it in our current health
care system to commit an error and “get away with it”? Can we
appropriately act upon dangerous behaviors and even more so if they turn
out to be repetitive? These are questions that take us in direction of the term
accountability. Despite its popularity, accountability is difficult to
characterize but most commonly understood as a normative concept, or
alternatively, can be used to explain a mechanism by which a system
learns.6 By assuming accountability, each individual is expected to be aware
of his/her actions and to understand that poor actions require a response in
order to prevent negative outcomes. For an individual health care worker,
this response may be a one-time behavioral adjustment. But for the system,
there could be a missed learning opportunity if the individual keeps the
event to himself/herself. Other health care workers could potentially repeat
the same error. Under ideal circumstances, therefore, a hospital's response
will be a systems change so that the error in question is more difficult to
commit in the future. In their article on “Striking a Balance,” Etchells and
colleagues argue for a shared responsibility that should emerge between the
individual and the system in which the individual acts.7
Things get thorny, however, when an individual health care worker will
not learn from near misses and errors and becomes a potential danger for
patients. A “no-blame” approach might not work in this case. This leads us
to the concept of a “Just Culture” outlined by David Marx,8 which balances
an atmosphere of trust that encourages reporting of patient safety issues
with clearly stated limits of tolerance beyond which a health care worker
will be reminded, counseled, coached, or disciplined. Instead of
blamelessness, there should be a sense of obligation to follow best practices
and maintain alertness for personal gaps in knowledge and/or performance
and system weaknesses. And, instead of punishment that does not
necessarily solve the underlying problem, people should only see
disciplinary action if other methods fail. There are different suggestions for
how an institution should respond to the spectrum of unsafe acts.7–9 While
many errors (and partly a so-called disruptive behavior) can be managed by
a behavioral intervention, substance abuse and intentional harm are
examples that are thought to always require disciplinary action.
Components of Accountability
At the individual level, accountability is the concept that an individual is
responsible for a set of activities and explaining or answering for their
actions.6 At the system level, there is a complex, reciprocating matrix of
accountability, which reflects all the diverse components. The model of a
single physician being accountable to a single patient has been replaced by
multifaceted relationships among multiple different parties in the health
care system. Multiple different entities can either be accountable or hold
others accountable, such as individual patients, physicians, nurses and other
clinical staff, hospitals, the government, and other regulatory agencies.
Gamm states that “accountability of health services organizations is defined
as taking into account and responding to political, commercial, community
and clinical/patient interests and expectations. Accountability is the process
by which health leaders pursue the objectives of efficiency, quality, and
access to meet the interests and expectations of these significant publics.”10
How to Foster a Sense of Accountability
A number of ideas have been developed to help create a new safety culture
in health care. Their common goal is to empower health care workers. One
way is to teach young professionals to “speak up” and question behaviors
and practices of coworkers that appear unsafe.11 This is much more difficult
when one is supposed to speak up about one's own errors. However, if
health care workers choose to not report their own errors, a large
opportunity to improve systems is missed.12 The Agency for Healthcare
Research and Quality (AHRQ) along with the Department of Defense
(DoD) has developed a tool box to enhance patient safety beyond
communication, which has as its core competencies the following:
1. Leadership
2. Situation monitoring 3. Mutual support 4. Communication13
These items suggest that monitoring colleagues could be part of the
accountability concept. Another, more difficult approach is to make it a
legal requirement to report patient safety incidents, as Denmark's patient
safety act did, while at the same time protecting health care workers from
sanctions.14 Before employees can even articulate safety concerns,
however, they should be encouraged to be mindful, which is comprised of
the following:
1. A constant concern about the possibility of failure 2. Deference to
expertise regardless of rank or status 3. Ability to adapt when the
unexpected occurs 4. Ability to concentrate on a task while having a
sense of the big picture 5. Ability to alter and flatten the hierarchy to fit
a specific situation15
How to Enforce Accountability
Accountability as a concept that builds upon mature and mindful health care
workers may not lend itself to be imposed on an institution. Yet, Wachter
and Pronovost proposed strong auditing strategies in order to ensure safe
practices but at the same time avoid punitive actions for practices where the
benefit for patient safety has not been clearly demonstrated.16 If there is
fear of punishment or blame, the health care provider may not feel
encouraged to disclose incidents. Among the suggested auditing strategies
are video surveillance, computerized triggers, and secret monitoring of
compliance. However, it remains unclear to what degree this enforcement
should occur from outside auditors or else if policing should be done by the
professional societies themselves.17 Regulators (such as the JC) or insurers
(such as Medicare) will likely mandate accreditation criteria more and more
if physicians do not find a balanced way of creating a new safety culture
while setting clear lines about what is inadequate behavior in their
colleagues and do the corresponding self-policing.
REGULATORY 
AGENCIES,
NATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS, AND
THEIR REQUIREMENTS
Regulatory Agencies
Regulatory agencies oversee the different components of the health care
system, from individual providers to entire hospitals. The vast amount of
different regulatory agencies and their roles can be quite confusing. The
stakeholders include federal agencies, state agencies, and private regulators
(Table 6-1). The origins of this disjointed system can be traced to the
longstanding tension between the federal, state, and local government plus
the integration of private organizations. One example of the regulatory
maze is the path an individual physician must take to practice. As Field
explains, the doctor must “attend a medical school that has received
accreditation by a private body, take a national examination administered by
another nongovernmental organization, obtain licensure from a state
medical boards, complete a hospital residency that is funded and governed
by the federal Medicare program, achieve certification from a private
specialty board, obtain privileges at a hospital that may operate as either a
private or public entity…and receive payment to actually earn a living from
Medicare.”18

Safety and Quality Reporting
There are a number of stakeholder agencies involved in patient safety and
quality reporting. All of these have the objective to improve patient safety,
by assisting with the measurement and description of events, the design of
interventions, the reporting of measures and outcomes, or the proposal of
norms. Among them are the JC, the NQF, the AHRQ, the Accreditation
Council on Graduate Medical Education (ACGME), the Institute for
Healthcare Improvement (IHI), the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services (CMS), and the Institute of Medicine (IOM).
Among those entities, the JC has defined National Patient Safety Goals
that 
are 
updated 
annually. 
Details 
can 
be 
found 
under:
http://www.jointcommission.org/assets/1/6/HAP_NPSG_Chapter_2014.pdf.
The 2014 goals for hospitals are the following:
The NQF has compiled a list of Serious Reportable Events (SREs) last
updated 
in 
2011
(http://www.qualityforum.org/Topics/SREs/Serious_Reportable_Events.asp
x). These SREs are grouped in the following categories: surgical or invasive
procedure events, product of device events, patient protection events, care
management events, environmental events, radiologic events, and potential
criminal events.
The AHRQ identified patient safety indicators (PSIs), last updated in
2015 (http://www.qualityindicators.ahrq.gov/Modules/PSI_TechSpec.aspx).
These PSIs cover postoperative complications, retained surgical items,
death in surgical patients or in patients with low risk for mortality, birth
traumas, transfusion reactions, pressure ulcers, and central line–associated
bloodstream infections.
Reporting
Health care institutions in many countries have set up internal reporting
systems for events that jeopardize patients' safety. Known as “incident
reporting systems,” these systems are supposed to detect unsafe events and
make them analyzable. Their goal is to enable quality improvement
initiatives. On the other hand, there is a trend toward public reporting of
patient safety issues as a quality indicator for hospitals; this corresponds to
the rise of public reporting of hospital-acquired infections, which is now
mandated 
in 
the 
majority 
of 
the 
US
(http://www.ncsl.org/documents/health/haireport.pdf). Here, we will discuss
intra- and extrainstitutional reporting separately.
Intrainstitutional Reporting
Incident reports (IR) are a form of passive surveillance in that they depend
on voluntary reporting by health care workers and do not rely on
standardized and objective criteria.19 Therefore, they mostly produce large
amounts of data that require additional classification and labor-intensive
analysis. It is unclear what impact incident reporting has on patient safety,
in part because incident reporting systems have been understudied.20,21
Aside from the labor intensity of IR systems, one of their major problems is
that they may suffer from both under- and overreporting and therefore
cannot produce reliable incident rates.22 Other requirements of a functional
reporting system have been elicited and include the following: (1)
supportive environment that protects confidentiality, (2) participation of all
types of health care workers, (3) feedback that should be given in a timely
manner, and (4) a structured approach for responding to problems and
designing interventions.23 One should add “user-friendliness” and
“maximum dissemination within the institution” as further requirements.
Current IR systems, however, may not be fully used as learning opportunity
for the respective institution. And reporting without corresponding
improvement initiatives may be relatively useless. Experts recommend
investigating only a small number of incidents but to do so thoroughly as
valuable information is often contained in the narrative of the incident.24
Public Reporting
As discussed above, there are a number of stakeholders in the field of
patient safety and quality improvement, but no single national regulator.
Therefore, adverse event reporting to outside the institution is mostly
regulated by the individual states (http://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-06-07-
00471.pdf). Approaches range from requiring broad reporting of medical
errors to focusing on the NQF's “Serious Reportable Events.” The State of
Minnesota is an example for employing these Serious Reportable Events as
marker 
events
(http://www.health.state.mn.us/patientsafety/ae/09aheeval.pdf). An example
for an organization that has developed a reporting system is the Institute for
Safe Medication Practices (ISMP), which operates a database on
medication errors (https://www.ismp.org/orderforms/reporterrortoismp.asp).
In summary, the best approach to public reporting of patient safety
events remains unknown. The goal should be to extract the maximum
amount of information from a select number of well-defined events and use
them both for outside reporting and for the institution's learning.
LAWS AND POLICIES
Laws may change, and it is not the purpose of this chapter to review all
relevant legislation with regard to patient safety. Of note, no entity
mandates metrics and measurement of patient safety in the US. Relevant
laws include:
The Patient Safety Act of 2005 is a milestone in patient safety
legislation 
(http://archive.ahrq.gov/news/newsroom/press-
releases/2008/psoact.html). Its goal is to improve patient safety by
encouraging voluntary and confidential reporting of events that
adversely affect patients.
Medicare's “no-pay” list of conditions for which US hospitals do not
receive reimbursement since October 2008: stage III and IV pressure
ulcers; fall or trauma resulting in serious injury; vascular catheter-
associated infection; CAUTI; foreign object retained after surgery;
certain surgical site infections; air embolism; blood incompatibility;
certain manifestations of poor blood sugar control; certain deep vein
thromboses; or pulmonary embolisms.
KEY POINTS
Accountability exists at the individual and system level.
Multiple regulatory agencies exist in health care at the national,
state, and local level and private agencies.
Hospitals are being evaluated by multiple different agencies based
upon their safety and quality indicators.

CLINICAL VIGNETTE
Bianca is a 15-year-old girl with a history of asthma who presented to
the emergency department (ED) at a local community hospital with
difficulty breathing. She had been using her inhaler for the past 2 days
without relief. At the ED, she was noted to have tight breath sounds
and obvious increased work of breathing. She was given a nebulizer
treatment of a bronchodilator and a dose of oral steroids. Clinicians at
the ED reviewed her previous medical history using the electronic
medical record (EMR). The EMR also provided the clinicians access
to the current best practice guidelines for asthma. Her condition did
not improve, and she was admitted to the hospital for further
management. After 2 days in the hospital, her condition improved and
she was ready to be sent home. Within the EMR, the doctors used the
electronic prescribing system to print out a refill of her metered-dose
inhaler (MDI), prescriptions for a 5-day course of oral steroids, and a
steroid MDI to help prevent future flare-ups. She was also advised to
follow up with her primary care physician within a week to assess her
response to the therapy.
How can healthcare information technology facilitate the
improvement of care delivered for patients like Bianca?
What is the role of healthcare information technology in quality
and patient safety efforts?
INTRODUCTION
In 21st-century medicine, healthcare information technology (HIT) is an
integral aspect of care delivery and is fast becoming ubiquitous in the
modern clinical setting. HIT is a collection of computer hardware and
software systems that operates within a care delivery ecosystem. When
implemented properly, HIT can help improve the quality and safety of care
delivery as well as facilitate process improvement and medical research.
When designed improperly, it leads to inefficiency, waste, and risks to
patient safety. The successful use of HIT depends upon a larger cultural
context and organizational framework, where the technology and
communication systems are consciously designed and optimized
harmoniously to provide an efficient end-user workflow, to improve
decision making, and to support a learning health care delivery system.
Timely health care data support a “learning” environment by providing all
health care stakeholders (providers, patients, families, decision makers) the
necessary information and knowledge for making better decisions,
improving care, and facilitating population health and research.1
Background
The 2001 Institute of Medicine (IOM) publication “Crossing the Quality
Chasm: A New Health System for the 21st Century” described the gaps in
the quality of care delivered in the US health care system. The report
identified the adoption of HIT as an essential component for addressing the
gaps in quality and safety. Specifically, modern health care informatics and
technology infrastructure need to support timely access to clinical
information, evidence-based clinical decision support (CDS), quality
measurement, health care research, and education.2 In 2003, the IOM
published the “Patient Safety: Achieving a New Standard for Care”
describing a model for a national health information infrastructure based on
data standards governing the capture, storage, and transmission of health
care information across disparate organizations and computer systems.3 In
order to address the gaps in quality and patient safety, the HIT framework
should present clinical information at the point of medical decision making
so that care providers can avoid, detect, and address risks to patient safety
and quality, even before the adverse event has occurred.4 In 2004, the
George W. Bush administration established the Office of the National
Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONCHIT) within the
Department of Health and Human Services to guide the nation's journey
toward adopting a national HIT infrastructure and providing Americans
access to more robust EHR by the year 2014.
“Meaningful Use” of HIT
Under the Barack Obama administration, the 2009 American Recovery and
Reinvestment Act (ARRA) included legislation that promoted the adoption
of EHR and other HIT standards that will support health information
exchanges (HIE) and interoperability while maintaining the security and
privacy of health care information. Through ARRA's Health Information
Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act,5 financial
incentive programs were implemented to rapidly develop the national HIT
framework to support a robust and interconnected care delivery system.6
This program included support for states to adopt HIEs, for providers to
adopt certified EHRs, and for communities to educate/train the new HIT
workforce. Specifically dubbed as the Meaningful Use EHR incentive
program, the effort is executed in successive phases or “stages,” designed to
incrementally improve the overall function and capabilities of the HIT
systems.7 As of September 2015, over 548,000 providers (hospitals and
medical professionals) in the US have signed up to participate in the
incentive program and together have received over $31 billion in direct
financial support.8 It is estimated that about 40% of doctor's offices (2012
data) and 85% of US hospitals (March 2013) have adopted EHR
technologies that support the goals of the federal HIT framework.9,10 The
Meaningful Use effort is expected to end by 2016 for Medicare and 2021
for Medicaid incentive program.11 This substantial national investment is an
important milestone to consider as we ponder upon the use of HIT in the
improvement of quality and patient safety in the US health care system.
HIT and Clinical Practice
The EMR has transformed the way care is delivered in the clinical settings.
When compared to paper-based medical records, well-designed EMR
systems have been shown to enhance the quality and convenience of care,
improve the patient's ability to participate in their care, improve efficiency
of medical practice, decrease cost of care, enhance coordination of services,
and improve process and outcomes of care. Table 7-1 provides examples of
the EMR benefits.
TABLE 
7-1

of 
EMR 
Benefits
Overall, the current evidence on the use of HIT in clinical practice tips
toward the favorable side.12 Given the current rate of HIT adoption, we
have barely scratched the surface of what it can do to impact care delivery.
Adoption of HIT is merely the first step in the journey in transforming the
way medicine is being practiced today. A cultural transformation following
HIT adoption must include human-centered engineering and design of
information systems, safe implementation of clinical computer software and
algorithms, highly evolved sociotechnical framework for systems
implementation, and more robust supporting policies for the effective use of
HIT in the clinical settings.13
The Electronic Medical Record and the
Electronic Health Record
The electronic medical record or EMR is often interchanged with the
electronic health record or EHR. For the purpose of this book, the EMR is
defined as the digital collection of the patient's medical information (notes,
medication, results, physiologic measurements, etc.) that is confined within
a scope of practice, whereas the EHR is a compilation of a patient's health
care information that spans across organizations (Table 7-2). The EMR is
equivalent to a patient's paper chart in a given medical office. The EMR is
usually supported by a set of computer hardware and software that are
designed for very specific clinical workflow and information requirements.
The EMR system is usually owned by the health care provider. Key
operational benefits of the EMR include legibility of documentation (and
spell check!), accessibility of the patient records, decreased storage space
requirements for paper charts, electronic prescribing, and CDS. However,
the EMR does not contain all the possible health information pertinent to
the patient's care outside its designated scope of practice. For example, the
EMR of a doctor's clinic or a hospital may only contain a portion of the
patient's entire medical information and may not contain information stored
in other institutions' EMR systems.
TABLE 7-2 Difference between Electronic Medical Records and Electronic
Health 
Records
In contrast, EHRs contain a wealth of patient information that spans
across organizations and other health care entities. It can even include
health care information derived from the patient such as the personal health
record (PHR). Figure 7-1 shows the relationship between EMRs and the
EHR. In other words, EHRs store the aggregate digitized health care
information about the patient, connecting patient information across
disparate data sources and EMRs. The EHR can scope a region, state, or
even a nation. The clinical workflow, information and functional
requirements, and governance structures required to maintain EHRs are
quite complex. More importantly, EHRs can only be established when
interoperability as well as business alignment exists across the participating
EMRs and organizations.14 The Meaningful Use incentive program aims to
increase the adoption of EMRs among providers and support the
development of HIE standards so that EMRs can connect to each other
seamlessly, thus moving the country closer to an ideal national EHR. When
implemented properly, EHRs can help improve quality of care, decrease
certain medical errors, enhance the organization's bottom line, reduce health
care costs, facilitate population health, and contribute to scientific
research.15
Figure 7-1 Relationship between electronic medical records and electronic
health records. Legend: EMR, electronic medical record; EHR, electronic
health record; PHR, personal health record.
Computerized Provider Order Entry
In the clinical settings, a key functionality of the EMR is to facilitate
computerized provider order entry (CPOE). CPOE enables doctors, nurses,
and other clinicians to enter orders electronically, as one would use in a
paper chart. These electronic orders are routed automatically to other
departments, such as a laboratory information system for lab orders or a
pharmacy information system for medication orders. As one can imagine,
CPOE requires an organization to link, or interface, the EMR to a number
of supporting clinical information systems. The degree of incompatibility
among these linked systems dictates the complexity (and cost) of the
process. The benefits of a properly implemented CPOE include fast
connections to supporting systems (labs, pharmacy), avoidance of
transcription errors, quick integration of orders into the EMR, and
prompting of clinical alerts like allergies, drug–drug interactions, and drug
dosing.16
HIT AND CLINICAL DECISION
SUPPORT SYSTEMS
Strong evidence in the literature shows that Clinical Decision Support
Systems (CDSS) improve care delivery processes.17 CDSS are electronic
systems with special computerized algorithms (known as clinical decision
support [CDS] rules), designed to assist with medical decision making
based on or triggered by certain clinical variables of interest. They can
include allergy alerts, reminder pop-ups for medication doses or
interactions, automated calculations or notifications, and special electronic
views of pertinent patient information. The CDS rules can be simple as in
an allergy alert or as complex as following a clinical pathway or guideline.
Supporting Clinicians
The goal of CDSS is to improve medical knowledge and aid human
cognition at the point of decision making. For example, CDSS can be
integrated into the EMR workflow so that clinicians can be alerted of the
clinical services (i.e., preventive, screening) that would be applicable to the
patient's visit. When ordering medications via the EMR, CDS rules can be
deployed to alert the clinician of specific information in the patient's record
such as worsening renal function (i.e., increasing creatinine) or other
potential drug reactions. CDSS can also be used to provide the clinician
with well-accepted practice recommendations that are tailored to the
patient's condition, such as preferred or alternative treatment guidelines
based on current medical evidence.18 One thing to note is that the success of
the CDSS in changing clinician behavior depends on how easily the
clinician can interact with the system. CDS rules that impede both physical
and cognitive workflow tend to be ineffective in changing clinician
practice. In fact, indiscriminate firing of alerts from the EMR can induce
“alert fatigue” among clinicians, and they can sometimes lead to adverse
patient outcomes.19 EMR-based alerts and reminders can sometimes
contribute to information overload and desensitizing the clinician to the
importance of the decision support.20,21
Supporting Patients
While CDSS has shown to improve clinician performance, the direct effect
on patient outcomes is less understood.17,22 CDSS impacts clinical
outcomes by influencing clinician behavior to adhere to best practices, such
as promoting preventive services or avoiding complications, by using
analytics and informatics to aggregate large datasets for process
measurement and surveillance efforts, and by minimizing adverse drug
events.23 However, the direct patient effect is dependent upon the culture of
the clinicians using the system as well as those building and implementing
the CDSS.24 Implementing health IT does not guarantee better outcomes. In
fact, there are undesirable patient safety consequences of poorly designed
computer systems (see e-iatrogenesis below).25
HIT AND ADVERSE HIT EVENTS
(E-IATROGENESIS)
Care delivery is becoming more dependent on computers when rendering
care. Thus, it is very important that the sum of all of the hardware and
software functions is aligned to maximize the positive effects of health care.
However, the science of implementing health IT into the clinical settings is
still at its infancy. Coined as “e-iatrogenesis,” these new types of errors are
a result of the human and computer interaction in the clinical settings.25
EMR systems constantly introduce change in clinician workflow (both
physical and cognitive). If the change is too much burden for end users,
then maladaptive behaviors ensue causing work-arounds. Applying human
factors and human-centric systems design are critical to the success of EMR
workflow adaptation in the clinical settings. More importantly, there are
errors that are derived directly from the design of the EMR itself! Poor
representation of data, confusing user interface, miscalculations, lack of
system 
navigation 
feedback, 
data 
omissions, 
poor 
training 
and
communication, barriers to access, and system performance issues are
among the HIT factors that causes end-user problems and subsequent
adverse patient safety events.26 The HIT industry must evolve quickly to
design systems that are intuitive and facilitate human cognition and
workflow. Encouraging further research on how electronic systems impact
patient safety is critical to the success of HIT. In 2011, the IOM publication
“Health IT and Patient Safety: Building Safer Systems for Better Care”
proposed mechanisms where HIT vendors and users can report HIT-related
adverse events and exchange this information across industry to encourage
the development of systems that are safe to use in the clinical settings.27
HIT 
AND 
QUALITY
MEASUREMENT
One cannot manage improvement efforts without a good measurement
system. Improving the quality of care requires meaningful and actionable
data about clinical processes and outcomes. Computer systems have an
innate ability to store large amounts of data. The data about clinical
processes and outcomes of care are increasingly captured and stored in
electronic databases with the advent of health care information systems in
the clinical settings. Clinical data derived from EMR systems (i.e., patients,
diagnoses, procedures, care providers, etc.) often contain the variables of
interest required in studying specific patient populations. In addition, data
from EMRs can be linked longitudinally to assess effectiveness of care as
well as for epidemiologic research.28 Clinical data can be used to augment
administrative and financial data to understand variations of care and
outcomes and to monitor the progress during improvement efforts.
Informatics Implications
At this time, most EMR systems are not specifically designed to support
quality measurement and improvement efforts. They are primarily designed
to support specific clinical workflow (such as a physician's office, or
hospital processes), to document care management and transactions, to
schedule patient interventions, and to support billing or reimbursement. The
advent of the 2009 Meaningful Use effort incentivizes providers to adopt
EMRs that can also be “meaningfully” used in process improvement
efforts.29
One of the major milestones that EMRs must overcome is to make the
clinical information “computable,” meaning that clinical information needs
to be processed by computer systems, in addition to being readable by
humans. Clinical data must be “codified” so it can be processed by
computers more efficiently, preferably using standardized and controlled
vocabularies.30 Standard datasets use the same concepts to encode data all
throughout the system's database. For example, the patient's “sex” may be
represented uniformly as “M” for male and “F” for female or perhaps “1”
for male and “2” for female. Regardless of which encoding system one is
using, conceptual representation of data must be consistent so it can also be
used for cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis and research. In addition,
encoded data can be readily used to trigger CDS rules. Today, there are a
number of health care terminologies (i.e., LOINC, SNOMED, ICD9,
RxNorm) that represent medical concepts like diagnosis, procedures,
laboratory tests, medications, etc. This is an important step in ensuring that
clinical data can be represented accurately across disparate clinical
information systems.
Analytics Implications
Although data standardization is vital to information processing and
interoperability, the data necessary for quality improvement must be
captured in the EMR system. Often, data that are needed for quality
measurement (such as specific clinical interventions, findings, adverse
events, etc.) are unstructured, hence not readily “computable.” In the EMR,
these types of data may be embedded in narrative texts, scanned documents,
or dictated notes, posing a challenge to computer-based analysis. Special
computer technologies such as optical character recognition (OCR) or
natural language processing (NLP) systems can be utilized to “mine” the
narrative clinical data; however, the institution must have the right
resources (people, software, $$) to leverage these tools.31 In some cases,
data required for quality improvement may not be available in the EMR;
hence, efforts must be in place to build and capture these data points within
the EMR so that they can be stored as discrete data in the data repository
and used in the measurement process. For example, in order to measure the
process and outcomes of venous thromboembolism (VTE) care in the
inpatient settings, it may be necessary to document the specific data
elements (e.g., contraindications for VTE prophylaxis) required to generate
the quality measures. More importantly, the information systems
stakeholders supporting the implementation of the EMRs must be able to
sustain the development of the data capture, data storage, data retrieval, and
data mining capabilities of the organization. The skill sets necessary to
maintain the analytics process are different from those tasked to implement
and maintain the EMRs. The tools involved in deploying analytics are also
different from the clinical applications. In addition, the costs required to
support the data capture and retrieval are not trivial and can be quite
daunting.
HIT 
WORK 
FORCE
TRANSFORMATION
As of November 2015, only 4.1% of 5454 US hospitals and 7.79% of
35,364 ambulatory offices have achieved the highest level of EMR
infrastructure to support clinical analytics, HIE, and continuity of care
documentation (also known as HIMSS U.S. EMR Adoption Model Stage
7).32 Fortunately, an overwhelming number of providers are either
implementing EMR or rapidly evolving to have more robust HIT systems. It
is projected that by 2019, about 90% of physicians and 70% of hospitals in
the US would have adopted robust EMR systems.33
Informaticists
With health care institutions adopting EMRs, there is an increased need for
a new breed of people with clinical backgrounds to be key contributors to
implementing health care information systems. Clinical informatics is a
new medical discipline aimed to advance the science, practice, and
implementation of HIT into health care. Clinical informaticists come with
medical, nursing, or pharmacy skills and IT skills to serve as conduits
between IT and the clinical domain.34–36 Effective implementation of
EMRs requires an amalgamation of clinical, managerial, and IT skills. To
fill this current void in the workforce, the American Board of Medical
Specialties launched the inaugural board certification for the medical
subspecialty of clinical informatics in October 2013.
IT Culture
Bridging the gap between the medical and technical cultures is a necessary
step for the optimal utilization of IT. As health care services become more
dependent on technology, any small change to the system can have a large
impact for clinicians and patients. A software upgrade of the EHR can lead
to significant changes in clinical workflow. For example, changing to
computer-based medication reconciliation can have huge impacts on the
workflow for physicians, nurses, and pharmacists. Stakeholders need to be
considered as IT is adapted in the workplace. Health care systems need
effective and efficient ways to inform clinicians about upgrades and
changes to the EMR. In addition, clinicians need to be able to reach out to
the IT department for support, questions, and EMR work flow improvement
ideas. Medicine is in a continual flux of new information and new
workflows. IT systems (and therefore IT support!) need to respond to these
fluctuations while continually striving to improve the quality of care
delivered. Health IT must lean forward to becoming more clinical than
technical, impacting health more than wealth, and supporting clinical
workflow more than cash flow.
CONCLUSION
The health care community is at a critical inflection point for utilization of
HIT. The use of computers in the clinical setting has grown exponentially,
yet full exploitation of the EMR is still in its infancy. As health care
transitions to the information age, there is great promise for improving the
safety and quality of care by improving workflow, supporting process
measurements, facilitating decision making through CDS and analytics, and
creating the platform for HIE for care coordination and population health.
Moving forward, the HIT industry must first overcome some of the
constraints to fulfill these goals. Foremost, functional requirements and
interoperability standards must be adopted so the clinical systems can “talk”
to each other in ways that support the care delivery process and ensuring
patient privacy and security. Next, the user interface design must evolve to
support the human–computer interaction so that clinicians find the systems
intuitive and easy to use. Having the ability to customize the EMR systems
to accommodate local customs and practices can improve its adoption and
enhance its ability to support care delivery. Additionally, the EMR systems
should have the capability and flexibility to be used for quality
improvement measurements, patient safety, and research. Finally, the
barriers (i.e., cost, resources) for acquiring and maintaining HIT systems
must be lowered so adoption is increased. Incentive program such as the
Meaningful Use effort is a good starting point that can help minimize
inequities of resource challenged care providers in adopting HIT. As we
look at how IT has profoundly transformed other industries, we have only
begun to realize the impact of HIT on the health care community.

8 Preventable Harm
Thomas Ciesielski, Emily Fondahn, and Keith F.
Woeltje
CLINICAL VIGNETTE
Patient JV is a 79-year-old woman with mild dementia, diabetes, and
hypertension who was admitted to the hospital with acute renal failure. In
her evaluation, she was determined to have an unsteady gait. She was
deemed to be a high fall risk in her nursing assessment. The nurses placed a
bed alarm to alert staff every time she got out of bed, and she was instructed
to only get up with assistance. On her fourth night in the hospital, she
attempted to get out of bed on her own to use the bathroom. She had an
unwitnessed fall and broke her right arm.
What types of preventable harm happen to patients while in the
hospital?
What strategies can hospitals implement to reduce the risk of
preventable harm to their patients?
PREVENTABLE HARM
As the introduction to this manual stated, a founding tenet of medicine is
“first, do no harm” to our patients. With the complexity of care increasing
and the population generally aging, our most vulnerable patients are at risk
for being harmed while in the health care environment. The harms can
cause significant morbidity and mortality to patients as well as significantly
increase the cost of care. Preventable harm can be defined as “a harm with
an identifiable and modifiable cause.”1 Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services (CMS) has defined hospital-acquired conditions to be reasonably
preventable based on the application of published, evidence-based
guidelines. However, unpublished data suggest that, for example, many
patients have appropriate prophylaxis ordered at the time of a venous
thromboembolism (VTE) occurring, suggesting that additional work is
necessary to determine which events are truly preventable and to ensure that
more effective prophylaxis is developed.
Hospitals can now be penalized for some conditions that are acquired in
the hospital—these are preventable harms. Beginning in 2008, the CMS
stopped paying hospitals for a subset of conditions that were not present on
admission by not allowing the conditions to elevate a patient into a higher
paying diagnosis-related group (DRG) category. This list now includes
multiple categories, including falls, deep vein thrombosis (DVT)/pulmonary
embolism (PE) (following some orthopedic procedures), and stage III/VI
pressure ulcers (PUs).2 CMS initiated a hospital-acquired condition
reduction program in 2014, which directly penalizes the bottoms quartile of
hospitals based upon three quality measures (Patient Safety Indicator [PSI]
90 composite, central line–associated bloodstream infection, and catheter-
associated urinary tract infection).3 This chapter discusses the scope of
many of the preventable harms and identifies major risk factors for the
harms and ways to minimize acquiring these conditions.
VENOUS THROMBOEMBOLISM
Introduction
VTE, including DVT and PE, is a well-established risk factor in
postoperative patients and certain medical conditions including myocardial
infarction (MI) and stroke.4 A DVT or PE following a total knee
replacement or hip replacement is considered a hospital-acquired condition
by CMS. A recent review estimated the risk of a hospital-acquired VTE at
about 2% of admissions; however, young ambulatory patients were
excluded.4 PE is a significant cause of mortality in the hospital—an
estimated 5–10% of all inhospital patient deaths are attributed to PE.5,6 The
US health care system spends between $4.5 and $14.2 billion annually on
preventable hospital-acquired VTEs.7
Definition
VTE refers to a DVT or a PE. A DVT is the formation of one or more blood
clots (thrombus) in one of the body's large veins, most commonly the lower
leg or calf.8 The clot can cause complete or partial blockage of circulation.
Some patients develop pain, swelling, discoloration, or redness of the skin,
but many patients with a DVT will be asymptomatic. Many patients have
no long-term consequences from a DVT, but they can cause significant
pain, leg swelling, skin breakdown, and painful ulcers. More significantly,
DVTs can lead to significant morbidity and death from a PE.8
A PE is the presence of one or more blood clots in the blood vessels of
the lungs. A PE can be caused if a portion of the blood clot in the leg breaks
loose and travels through the bloodstream to the heart and then to the lungs.
Symptoms include shortness of breath, chest pain (especially when taking a
deep breath), fast heart rate, coughing up blood, or passing out from low
blood pressure.9 Death can occur if the lungs blood vessels are completely
blocked by the clot.
Risk Factors
Most hospitalized patients have at least one risk factor for a DVT.10
Inherited risk factors include an inherited thrombophilia, such as factor V
Leiden gene mutation, prothrombin gene mutation, or a protein C or protein
S deficiency.11 Acquired risk factors include recent major surgery, presence
of a central venous catheter, trauma, immobilization, malignancy,
pregnancy, 
use 
of 
oral 
contraceptives 
or 
hormonal 
agents,
myeloproliferative 
disorders, 
antiphospholipid 
syndrome, 
obesity,
congestive heart failure, and a history of a prior thrombotic event.12–14
Virchow triad proposes that VTEs are often due to the following three
factors:
1. Alterations in blood flow (stasis) such as prolonged bed rest or
immobilization 2. Vascular endothelial injury such as surgery or
trauma 3. Hypercoaguable state:
a. Inherited, which creates a genetic tendency to form VTEs b.
Acquired such as malignancy, pregnancy, or use of estrogen
Often, patients will have a combination of risk factors for VTE. Even
after discharge, these risks persist.
Prevention
VTE Prophylaxis Guidelines
The American College of Chest Physicians published guidelines in Chest
for VTE prevention in orthopedic surgery patients, nonorthopedic surgery
patients, and nonsurgical (medical) patients in 2009 from an exhaustive
review of the evidence (Table 8-1).

Guidelines

Preventions
Ensuring VTE Prophylaxis
Applying appropriate prophylaxis can decrease VTE in hospitalized patients
only if administered. Only 30–50% of eligible patients receive VTE
prophylaxis.17 Passive strategies, including guideline dissemination resulted
in poor adherence to prophylaxis. Higher prophylaxis rates were seen at
centers using proactive strategies, such as computer-based clinical decision
support, documentation aids, audit and feedback, and active monitoring.
Implementation and dissemination of VTE guidelines can include
education, alerts, or a multifaceted approach.
A tertiary care teaching hospital increased their VTE prophylaxis rate
from 63% to 96% using provider education, reminders, and decision
support tools as well as monthly audits and feedback over a 4-year
period.18 Unfortunately, similar interventions used in the Strategies to
ENhance venous ThRomboembolism prophYlaxis in hospitalized
medical patients (SENTRY) trial did not increase VTE prophylaxis
rates across 6 hospitals.19
A short, three-item checklist encouraging VTE risk assessment and
appropriate prophylaxis nonsignificantly increased patients undergoing
risk assessment (p = 0.06) but did significantly increase inpatients
being appropriately prescribed VTE prophylaxis (p = 0.006).20
A recent Cochrane Review evaluated results from 54 studies and found
that alerts, including computer alerts and stickers on patient charts
increased VTE prophylaxis rates by 13% and a multifaceted (education
and alerts) approach further increased VTE prophylaxis rates.21
While education can help convince providers for the need for change, a
forcing function may also be necessary to ensure consistent performance.22
One option is making VTE risk assessment and prophylaxis selection
required on every patient and to integrate the orders into the provider's work
flow. For example, use of a forcing order set increased VTE prophylaxis
rates from 35–55% to 70–85%.17
FALLS
Introduction
Falls are a significant issue facing hospitalized patients, affecting up to 12%
of all admissions at a rehabilitation hospital; when aged adjusted, falls
occur in 18–20% of admissions.23 At a large academic institution, there is
an estimated fall rate of 3.38 falls per 1000 patient days.24 Some form of
injury occurs in approximately 26% of inpatient falls with moderate or
major injury occurring in 2.4% of all the falls.25 Inpatient falls are more
likely to occur in evening/night, be unassisted, occur from a loss of balance,
and be related to toileting.24 Costs associated with falling are significant
due to an increased length of stay, regardless of degree of harm.26 Patients
that fall and sustain serious injury incur significantly higher costs
(>$13,000) than patients who do not experience a fall.27
Definition
A fall can be defined as an unplanned descent to the floor with or without
injury to the patient.28 Injuries can include fractures, lacerations, or internal
bleeding. The National Database of Nursing Quality Indictors categorizes
the types of injury as28:
None—patient did not sustain an injury secondary to the fall
Minor—those injuries requiring a simple intervention
Moderate—injuries requiring sutures of splints
Major—injuries that require surgery, casting, or further examination
(e.g., for a neurologic injury)
Deaths—result from injuries sustained from the fall
Risk Factors
Multiple risk factors exist for patient falls and each patient will have a
unique combination of risk factors. Just by being in the hospital, every
patient is at risk for a fall. Risk for falling can be broken down into patient
factors, environmental factors, and high-risk medications.
Patient risk factors:
Age ≥75 (crude odds ratio [cOR] 2.6 [95% CI 1.2–5.60])29
Impaired mental status (sedated or unconscious) (cOR 3.8 [95% CI
1.2–11.9])29
History of falls (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.73 [95% CI 1.79–4.16])30
Use of assistive device (aOR 3.17 [95% CI 1.47–6.80]) or person
(aOR 2.08 [95% CI 1.31–3.31]) for ambulation30
BMI ≤ 18.5 (aOR 2.35 [95% CI 1.17–4.74]) or ≥30 (aOR 1.58 [95%
CI 1.01–2.48])30
Dizziness (aOR 2.12 [95% CI 1.05–4.28])30
Incontinence (aOR 1.53 [95% CI 1.00–2.33])30
Environmental risk factors:
Positioning of the bathroom, flooring, wet floors, lighting, and
furniture are all likely contributing factors.31
Geriatric Psychiatry floor (cOR 3.7 [95% CI 1.8–7.4]).29
High-risk medications:
Hydantoin anticonvulsants (3.25 [95% CI 1.33–7.95])30
Haloperidol (aOR 2.80 [95% CI 1.16–6.77])30
Tricyclic anticonvulsants (aOR 2.43 [95% CI 1.21–4.90])30
Benzodiazepines (aOR 2.19 [95% CI 1.46–3.29])30
Insulin (aOR 1.46 [95% CI 1.01–2.13])30
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (OR 1.04 [95% CI 1.04–2.97])32
An opiate (OR 1.59 [95% CI 1.4–2.20])32
A nonantihypertensive diuretic agent (OR 1.53 [95% CI 1.03–2.26])32
Multiple tools have been developed to quickly and consistently assess a
patient's risk of falling. Assessment of risk factors is an important step in
fall prevention to help identify key risk factors, target preventive
interventions to the correct patient, facilitate care planning, and facilitate
communication between health care workers.33 Tools that have been studied
include the Maine Medical Center Falls Risk Assessment/Interventions
(MMC), the New York-Presbyterian Fall and Injury Risk Assessment Tool
(NY), St. Thomas Risk Assessment Tool in Falling Elderly Inpatients
(STRATIFY), Morse Fall Scale (MFS), and the Hendrich II Fall Risk
Model Sensitivity (HFRM) and the Johns Hopkins Fall Risk Assessment
Tool. These tools use different combinations of known risk factors (Table 8-
2) and have been compared in an acute care setting.34 There is currently no
consensus about which tool is the best to use in the acute care setting, and
institutions should adopt a tool that meets their needs.
TABLE 
8-2 
Fall 
Risk 
Assessment
Importantly, these tools should be used to aid clinical decision making,
not replace it. These tools only predict fall risk rather than prevent falls.
Individual patients may have unique risk factors for falls that are not
captured in these tools, and the sensitivity and specificity can vary based
upon the patient population (Table 8-3).34–36
TABLE 8-3 Sensitivity and Specificity of Fall Risk Assessments
aBased upon scoring cutoff.
Prevention
While there have been many interventions that have attempted to
decrease falls in the hospital, there are few proven techniques.
Calcium/vitamin D (cholecalciferol) supplementation in elderly
patients in a long-stay geriatrics unit awaiting placement led to a 49%
reduction in falls (Poisson regression estimate: −0.68, 95% CI 14–71%
p = 0.01).37
Patient education—preprinted care plan with targeted interventions
decreased the risk of falling on acute care and community care facility
wards, RR 0.79 (95% CI 0.65–0.95).38
Exercise—exercise alone is likely insufficient to reduce falls. A meta-
analysis of 13 randomized trials found no reduction in rate of falls in
patients assigned to supervised exercise versus usual care (RR 1.03,
95% CI 0.81–1.31).39
Medication review—medication review and adjustment of medication
regimen to manage polypharmacy and psychotropic medications may
be beneficial. A large randomized control trial demonstrated that a
pharmacist review of the medication list in a nursing home lead to
decreased falls (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.53–0.72).40
Hip protectors may be helpful in patients with a high risk of falls.
However, there is no evidence to support universal hip protectors and
compliance is often poor.41
Bed alarms—the use of bed alarms to prevent falls has not been well
established, even though these devices are widely used. One problem
with alarms is the common “false-positive” signals that can be
irritating to staff and patients.
Given the wide variety of patient, environment, and medication risk
factors, there is no one-size-fits-all solution to fall prevention. A number of
other strategies, such as toileting interventions and footwear, have been
implemented by hospitals. These strategies do not have great evidence
supporting their use, but do make common sense. Basic safety measures
include fall prevention education, keeping a pathway in the room clear,
wearing nonskid footwear, having the call light within reach, having
personal items within reach, keeping the bed low with brakes on,
orientation to the room and hourly rounding, and having adequate light
present. Essentially, the information gained from the fall risk assessment
needs to be paired with appropriate interventions for each patient (Fig. 8-1).
Figure 8-1 Fall risk assessment and interventions. (Adapted from Wolf L,
Costantinou E, Limbaugh C, et al. Fall prevention for inpatient oncology
using lean and rapid improvement event techniques. HERD Health Environ
Res Des. 2013;7(1):85–101.42)
Physical Restraints
A physical restraint is defined as “any physical or mechanical device,
material or equipment attached or adjacent to the patient's body that the
individual cannot remove easily. This device restricts the freedom of
movement or normal access to the patient's own body.”43 Restraints have
been applied to patients for issues including fall reduction and agitation.
However, use of restraints has not been shown to prevent falls, and in
reality, patients with orders for restraints were more likely to fall than
patients without such orders, OR 6.3 (95% CI 1.8–22.3), though there was
poor correlation between orders for restraints and restraint use at the time of
the inpatient falls.44 Restraints can be used for patients with significant
behavioral issues or concern for self-harm; however, a recent systematic
review found that use of restraints is associated with a number of bad
outcomes, including45:
Failure to be discharged to home (pooled OR 12.42 [95% CI 16–
21.52])
Death during the hospitalization (pooled OR 11.24 [95% CI 6.07–
20.83])
Nosocomial infection (pooled OR 3.46 [95% CI 1.93–6.22])
Fall during hospitalization (pooled OR 6.79 [95% CI 3.44–13.39])
The authors of a recent systematic review examining the use of physical
restraints put forth the following conclusion “…restraints should only be
used as a last resort, minimal level of restraint be used, for the minimal
duration and that the restrained person should be closely monitored.”45 This
recommendation aligns with CMS, which states that “Restraint or seclusion
may only be imposed to ensure the immediate physical safety of the patient,
a staff member, or others and must be discontinued at the earliest possible
time.”46
Chemical Restraints
Chemical restraints are pharmaceuticals that are given to agitated patients to
control behavior. Common medications include antipsychotic agents (e.g.,
haloperidol) 
and 
benzodiazepines 
(e.g., 
lorazepam), 
given 
either
independently or in combination. These medications have significant side
effects, including death. There is a further increased risk for adverse events
when the two are administered concomitantly to older patients.43 No current
guidelines exist for the proper use of chemical restraints, and care should
likely be taken to use chemical restraints sparingly.
PRESSURE ULCERS
PUs are an unfortunate condition that develops from unrelieved pressure to
the soft tissue over a bony prominence. Common locations are the
hip/buttocks or the heel. PUs range from a slight reddening of the skin to
full-thickness loss of tissue and exposed bone.47 Infections are the most
common complication of PUs and can range from a localized infection
around the ulcer to osteomyelitis (infection of the bone).47 A PU can
develop within 2 to 6 hours.48
A recent study estimates the incidence of a Medicare patient developing
a new PU during a hospital stay at about 4.5%.49 Certain populations are at
much higher risk for PUs and more severe complications; one series
documented that 17% of patients with PU due to spinal cord injury or stroke
developed osteomyelitis.50 Patients that develop PUs have a higher
inhospital mortality, length of stay, and readmission rate.49 With appropriate
systems in place, the risk of developing PUs can be reduced.
Definition
The National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel (NPUAP) has a commonly
used staging system (Table 8-4).51 The ulcer should be evaluated for size,
depth, presence of sinus tracks, necrotic tissue, exudates, and presence of
granulation tissue. The external appearance can underestimate the extent of
injury because patients can have the “tip-of-the-iceberg” phenomenon with
the largest portion of the wound located deep and less skin involvement.52
Pictures of the ulcers can be helpful to document changes over time, but the
technique for photography should be consistent and include an
identification sign with patient identification, date, and wound location.48
TABLE 
8-4 
NPUAP 
Pressure 
Ulcer 
Staging 
System
Hospitals are being penalized if a stage III/IV PU develops during the
hospital stay. Documenting of the stages of skin breakdown that are present
upon admission to the hospital is exceedingly important.
Risk Factors
The most important risk factors for developing a PU include immobility,
malnutrition, reduced perfusion, and sensory loss. Over 100 risk factors
have been identified for PU development (Table 8-5).47,48 Sores can
progress due to the presence of infection, inflammation, and edema.53
TABLE 8-5 Risk Factors for the Development of PUs47
Furthermore, there are scoring systems available to evaluate an
individual patient's risk of developing a PU, including the Braden Scale, the
Norton Scale, and the Waterlow Scale—however, there is no current high-
quality evidence demonstrating that use of any of the scales decreases the
incidence of PUs.54 The NPUAP recommends the following for a risk
assessment55:
Conduct a structured risk assessment as soon as possible (but within a
maximum of eight hours after admission) to identify individuals at risk
of developing PUs.
Repeat the risk assessment as often as required by the individuals'
acuity.
Undertake a reassessment if there is any significant change in the
individual's condition.
Include a comprehensive skin assessment as part of every risk
assessment to evaluate any alterations to intact skin.
Document all risk assessments.
Develop and implement a risk-based prevention plan for individuals
identified as being at risk of developing PUs.
Prevention
Management of underlying contributing factors remains the most important
aspect of prevention.56 There are certainly many products available for PU
reduction; the following strategies provide the best evidenced at preventing
PUs:
Foam mattresses, low-pressure mattresses, and overlays likely reduce
the risk of developing PUs compared to “standard” hospital
mattresses.57
Optimal nutrition is important for wound healing and should be
assessed and corrected for patients with deficiencies.48 However, there
is little evidence to support nutritional supplements in patients without
specific deficiencies.56
The NPUAP recommends preventive skin care including avoiding
positioning an individual on an area of erythema if possible, keeping
skin clean and dry, avoiding vigorously rubbing or massaging the skin
at risk of ulcers, protecting skin from excessive moisture, developing
an individualized continence management plan, and considering a skin
moisturizer to hydrate dry skin.55
Frequent repositioning (e.g., at least every 2 hours) is recommended to
reduce duration and magnitude of pressure over vulnerable areas of the
body; however, this strategy may not be possible in all patients due to
their underlying medical condition. Heels should be free of pressure
and knees should be in a slightly flexed position (5–10 degrees).55
Quality improvement projects that track and monitor PUs have been
implemented in single hospitals and health systems and have led to a
decrease in severe PUs and PUs in general.58,59
CONCLUSION
The common theme with the preventable harms presented here is that it is
necessary to assess each patient's risks to identify the most at risk
population to be able to employ the appropriate prophylaxis or intervention
most efficiently. There are interventions that mitigate the harms presented
here and strategies need to be employed to introduce these interventions—it
may take a quality improvement initiative to be able to effectively add these
systems.

Health 
Care–Associated
Infections
Rachael A. Lee and Bernard C. Camins
CLINICAL VIGNETTE
A 65-year-old man presents to the hospital for incision and debridement of
his left knee prosthesis. He underwent a left knee arthroplasty just 6 weeks
prior. Cultures taken in the operating room eventually were positive for
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The prosthetic device
was removed and replaced with an antibiotic-impregnated spacer in
anticipation for a planned revision after successful treatment with
intravenous antibiotics. While reviewing other cases of orthopedic implant
infections, the health care epidemiologist and the infection prevention
specialist remembered that 2 months prior to this patient undergoing the
primary arthroplasty procedure, another patient had undergone an incision
and debridement of a right hip prosthesis for MRSA. The patient's isolate
and the previous isolate were sent to a reference laboratory for molecular
analysis for comparison. The result of the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, a
technique used for genetic fingerprinting, revealed that the two isolates
were identical. Since there was no overlap in the dates of the patients'
hospitalization, it is plausible that the earlier MRSA isolate was transmitted
to the latter patient through environmental contamination or health care
workers' hands.
Questions
What types of health care–associated infections should concern health
care workers?
How is a surgical site infection defined?
How can one prevent the incidence of health care–associated
infections?
What strategies can hospitals use to increase hand hygiene
compliance?
INTRODUCTION
Health care–associated infections (HAIs) represent a major threat to patient
safety, affecting about 1 out of 25 hospitalized patients, leading to
substantial morbidity, mortality, and excess health care expenditures.1 An
estimated 440,000 infections occur annually, with costs estimated to be $9.8
billion.2 The types of HAIs include central line–associated bloodstream
infection (CLABSI), catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI),
surgical site infection (SSI), and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
Although CLABSIs were found to be the most costly per episode, over a
third of these costs was attributable to SSIs.2 HAIs associated with MRSA
are associated with significant morbidity and mortality, with a substantial
proportion of colonized patients subsequently developing an MRSA
infection.2 Studies have shown that interventions can reduce the incidence
of HAI and at least 50% are estimated to be preventable.2
PREVENTION OF HEALTH CARE–
ASSOCIATED INFECTIONS
Hand Hygiene
Since Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis demonstrated that the rate of puerperal
(childbed) fever can be drastically reduced through appropriate
handwashing in the 1800s, hand hygiene remains the most effective
preventive method in the prevention and control of nosocomial infections.
Alcohol-based hand hygiene solutions have significantly improved the
ability for a health care worker to adhere to hand hygiene policies, but
adherence to these policies remains as low as 40%.3
Monitoring of adherence to hand hygiene guidelines has become
standard in acute care facilities but continues to be a challenge, and no
national standards of measurement have been established. Direct
observation is considered the gold standard method and provides the most
detailed information about hand hygiene compliance by health care
personnel.4 The most commonly accepted framework for measuring hand
hygiene opportunities is the World Health Organization's (WHO) Five
Moments for Hand Hygiene (see Fig. 9-1):
Figure 9-1 WHO's five opportunities for hand hygiene. (Reprinted from
World Health Organization: Your 5 Moments for Hand Hygiene, Copyright
2006. http://www.who.int/gpsc/tools/Five_moments/en/. Accessed 5/15/15.)
Moment 1: before touching the patient, to prevent colonization of the
patient with health care–associated microorganisms
Moment 2: before a clean/aseptic procedure, preventing HAIs that
could arise from the patient's endogenous microorganisms or
organisms on health care personnel
Moment 3: after body fluid exposure, reducing the risk of transmission
of organisms from a colonized site to a clean site
Moment 4: after touching the patient, to minimize the risk of
transmitting microorganisms to the environment
Moment 5: after touching the patient surroundings to avoid hand
contamination3
There are different methods to improve hand hygiene adherence, and
each method has strengths and weaknesses:
Direct observation monitoring of hand hygiene behavior is the gold
standard for adherence; it is the only method that can discern all
opportunities for hand hygiene within patient care encounters.
However, direct observation is labor intensive and subject to the
Hawthorne Effect—behavior change based on the awareness of
subjects that they are being observed.3
Technology-assisted direct observation includes the use of mobile
devices or video-monitoring equipment to document hand hygiene
adherence, but video monitoring has limited opportunity for immediate
feedback and has potential for impacting patient privacy.3
Product volume or event count measurement can be used as an indirect
measurement of hand hygiene adherence. An example is counting all
the empty (used) soap containers. This method is not subject to
observer bias and may assist in optimal location of soap or foam
dispensers but cannot assess adequacy of technique or distinguish
between each of the hand hygiene opportunities.3
Intelligent hand hygiene systems are a new technology being
developed. Health care personnel will wear a mobile component that
can record all hand hygiene opportunities, provide feedback, and
respond to personnel behavior. This method is expensive to implement
and still cannot distinguish certain types of opportunities within the
patient encounter.3
Self-report can raise individuals' awareness of their own practice but is
unreliable as health care personnel overestimate their performance.3
Several studies have compared the efficacy of hand hygiene products
against bacteria. In the majority of studies, alcohol concentrations between
62% and 95% are more effective than antimicrobial soaps.3 Additionally,
alcohol-based regimens have significantly better efficacy in removing
several viruses compared with antimicrobial soap.
Hand hygiene technique is important, and the minimal time required by
manufacturers of hand hygiene products is generally 15–20 seconds, but
recent studies suggest that 15 seconds is insufficient for meeting high-
quality hand disinfection standards. In 2009, the WHO published guidance
on a standardized multistep technique to promote coverage of all surfaces of
the hands, taking approximately 20–30 seconds to complete.3
Both hand hygiene and gloves are complementary strategies to prevent
transmission of infection within the hospital, but controversy remains about
the need for hand hygiene prior to donning nonsterile gloves. The Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines emphasize hand
hygiene relative to patient contact or contact with patient surroundings, yet
the WHO recommends that when an indication for hand hygiene precedes a
contact that also requires glove usage, hand hygiene should be performed.3
CATHETER-ASSOCIATED
URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS
Introduction
CAUTI is one of the most common health care–acquired infections,
accounting for 12.9% of health care infections.5 Recent prevalence surveys
report 23.6% of hospitalized patients have a urinary catheter and 70–80% of
CAUTIs have been attributable to use of an indwelling urethral catheter.5–7
While <3% of patients with bacteriuria develop bacteremia with a
urinary isolate, given the high rate of catheter use, CAUTI is one of the
most common causes of secondary bacteremia in acute care facilities.5 Case
fatality rate of CAUTIs is approximately 2.3% in US hospitals, with up to
9% morality in bacteremia-associated urinary tract infections and 25–60%
in patients with urosepsis.8
The annual direct medical cost of CAUTIs is estimated to be $340 to
$370 million. As of 2008, the Centers of Medicare and Medicaid Services
(CMS) no longer reimburses hospitals for cost related to CAUTI, resulting
in renewed effort to prevent and control CAUTIs.9,10
Definition
Clinical diagnosis of CAUTI remains challenging, as neither pyuria nor
bacteriuria is a reliable indicator of symptomatic UTI.10 According to the
National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN), CAUTI is defined as a
urinary tract infection in which an indwelling catheter was in place for more
than two calendar days on the date of the event.8 Localizing signs and
symptoms may not be present or recognized secondary to comorbidity or
inability to communicate; the most common presentation is fever and a
positive urine culture. Candida species is no longer considered a CAUTI
pathogen. While pyuria suggests underlying inflammation, the presence or
absence of pyuria is not indicative of CAUTI.9 This definition lacks
specificity given high rates of bacteriuria and will likely lead to
overestimation of CAUTI incidence rates.6
Risk Factors
Duration of catheterization is a major risk factor for CAUTI and the most
important determinant of bacteriuria, with a daily risk of acquisition of 3–
7%. Bacteriuria is universal once a catheter remains in place for several
weeks.5,6,8 Bacteriuria develops quickly, and biofilm formation, a complex
community of host proteins and organisms that adhere along the catheter
surface, can occur.5,10 Organisms growing within the biofilm are relatively
protected from antimicrobials and host defenses.
Catheter trauma and catheter obstruction are well recognized as
precipitating events for CAUTI. Other CAUTI risk factors include female
sex, severe underlying illness, nonsurgical disease, age >50 years, catheter
insertion outside the operating room, diabetes mellitus, and renal function
impairment.9,10 Bacteremia from a urinary source has been linked to
neutropenia, renal disease, and male sex.5
Prevention
The single most important intervention to prevent CAUTI is avoiding use of
an indwelling urinary catheter except in a limited number of accepted
indications, including monitoring of urinary output in critically ill patients,
perioperative use for selected surgical procedures, and management of
urinary retention or obstruction, and to facilitate healing of open pressure
ulcers.5 Unfortunately, 38% of physicians are not aware of urinary catheter
use in their patients. Addressing the necessity of the urinary catheter as part
of their daily routine may lead to reduction in its use. Additionally, written
guidelines for catheter use, insertion, and maintenance should be available
at all health care facilities.6,9
Catheters should be removed when no longer indicated. Educational
reminders have been shown to provide a significant reduction in
inappropriate use of urinary catheters by using a nurse-driven
multidisciplinary approach to evaluate necessity of urinary catheters.9 A
systematic review of catheter discontinuation strategies for hospitalized
patients reported that a stop order reduced duration of catheter use by 1.06
days and decreased rates of CAUTI by 53%.5
Catheters should always be inserted under aseptic conditions using
sterile equipment with the smallest possible catheter to avoid urethral
trauma. Strict adherence to hand hygiene practice is recommended and most
outbreaks of urinary pathogens have been linked to inadequate hand
hygiene.10 Both the catheter and collecting system should be replaced if
breaks occur in the closed drainage system.9
There is limited evidence that antibiotic prophylaxis decreases the rate
of bacteriuria; however, it has been shown to select for antimicrobial-
resistant organisms.9 A recent meta-analysis found six trials comparing
antibiotic prophylaxis versus no prophylaxis in short-term catheterization
(up to 2 weeks) and revealed decreased bacteriuria but no change in the rate
of symptomatic CAUTIs.8
Introducing a UTI bundle, including avoidance of catheter insertion,
maintenance of sterility, product standardization, and early catheter
removal, has been shown to decrease catheter utilization from 100% to 73%
and CAUTI rate from 5.9 to 2.6 per 1000 catheter days in a neurologic
intensive care unit (ICU).6
CENTRAL 
LINE–ASSOCIATED
BLOODSTREAM INFECTIONS
Introduction
Central venous catheters (CVC) are ubiquitous in the ICU, with over 15
million CVC days occurring each year.11 Approximately 250,000 cases of
CLABSIs occur yearly, with 30,000–60,000 deaths attributed to infection.11
CLABSIs are associated with increased length of hospital stay as well as
increased cost, varying from $3700 to $39,000 per episode.12
Definition
As defined by NHSN, a CLABSI is a laboratory-confirmed bloodstream
infection (BSI) where a central line was in place for >2 calendar days from
the time the blood culture is drawn.
In order to meet the criteria for laboratory-confirmed BSI, one of the
following two situations must be present:
The patient has a recognized pathogen cultured from one or more
blood cultures.
The patient has at least one sign or symptom of infection, such as fever
(>38.0°C), chills, or hypotension, and a positive laboratory result not
related to an infection in another site. If the blood culture is positive
for a common commensal organism (e.g., coagulase-negative
Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium spp. not C. diphtheria, Bacillus spp.
not B. anthracis), two or more blood cultures collected within a
calendar day must be positive before this criterion is met.
These criteria include the caveat that the organism cultured from the
blood cannot be related to infection at another site, such as a urinary tract
infection or intra-abdominal infection cultured with the same bacteria.
Risk Factors
Numerous risk factors have been associated with increased risk of CLABSI
(see Table 9-1).13 Major risk factors include insertion with less than
maximum sterile barriers, placement in an old site via guidewire exchange,
heavy cutaneous colonization at the catheter hub, and duration of catheter
placement >7 days.13
TABLE 9-1 Risk Factors that Affect Risk for Development of CLABSI
Prevention
Use of prevention bundles that focus on catheter insertion has shown to be
effective, sustainable, and cost-effective.12 Their success depends on
adherence to each individual measure (see Fig. 9-2).
Figure 9-2 Checklist for prevention of CLABSI.
(Adapted from the 2011 CDC guidelines for prevention of intravascular catheter-associated BSIs.
http://www.cdc.gov/HAI/pdfs/bsi/checklist-for-CLABSI.pdf)
Education of health care personnel involved in insertion, care, and
maintenance of CVCs has been shown to reduce the incidence of
CLABSI.12 Health care professionals who insert a CVC should undergo a
credentialing process to ensure competency prior to insertion of a CVC
independently; simulation training has been shown to be effective.12
Checklists allow institutions to adhere to infection prevention practices
at the time of insertion, and health care personnel should ensure that proper
aseptic technique is maintained.12 Checklists should include performing
hand hygiene prior to catheter insertion or manipulation.
The preferred sites of placement for central lines are femoral,
subclavian, and internal jugular veins. Previous studies have shown that the
femoral site is associated with an increased risk for infection, but a recent
meta-analysis showed no difference in the rate of CLABSI between all
three sites.11 Current recommendations recommend avoiding femoral vein
catheterization in obese adult patients unless the catheter is placed under
planned and controlled conditions.12 If placing a central line in the internal
jugular vein, use of ultrasound guidance is recommended as studies have
shown a reduction in the risk of CLABSI and complications.12
Full sterile barrier precautions are recommended during insertion,
which include mask, cap, sterile gown, and sterile gloves to be worn by all
health care personnel involved in the insertion procedure. Full-body sterile
drapes should be placed on the patient during insertion. The Seldinger
technique for catheter insertion allows for central veins to be cannulated
with less risk of pneumothorax and vascular injury. Prospective randomized
trials have indicated that exchange of catheter over a guidewire is
associated with a twofold increased risk of catheter-related bloodstream
infection.13
Heavy colonization at the insertion site has been associated with
CLABSIs, and reduction of microflora at a potential insertion site is a
priority. Chlorhexidine-based antiseptics exhibits prolonged antimicrobial
activity on the skin surface after a single application compared to alcohol-
only or iodine-based antiseptics.13 All catheter hubs, needless connectors,
and injection ports should be disinfected prior to accessing the catheter with
either chlorhexidine–alcohol solution, 70% alcohol, or povidone–iodine.
Applying mechanical friction for no <5 seconds reduces contamination.12
While the risk of CLABSI is reduced with antiseptic-impregnated
catheters and antimicrobial-impregnated catheters, use of these specialized
catheters is only recommended in three scenarios: (1) hospital units or
patient populations that have CLABSI rates above institutional goals
despite compliance with basic CLABSI principles; (2) patients who have
limited venous access and a history of recurrent CLABSI; or (3) patients
who are at risk of severe sequelae from CLABSI.12
VENTILATOR-ASSOCIATED
EVENTS
Introduction
The true incidence of VAP is difficult to determine, as surveillance
definitions have changed and have poor specificity. Approximately 5–10
health care–associated pneumonias per 1000 hospital admissions occur
yearly and 10–20% of ventilated patients will develop VAP, although more
recent reports have suggested lower rates of VAP.14,15 Mortality of VAP is
estimated to be 10% but varies depending on patient factors.
Nasally or orally ventilated patients are at risk for a variety of
complications 
including 
acute 
respiratory 
distress 
syndrome,
pneumothorax, pulmonary embolism, lobar atelectasis, and pulmonary
edema. These terms have been included in the catch-all phrase ventilator-
associated events (VAEs), and approximately 5–10% of mechanically
ventilated patients develop VAEs.14 VAEs extend patient's duration of
mechanical ventilation, increase intensive care and hospital length of stay,
and increase mortality risk, although excess costs attributable to VAE have
not been quantified.14,16
Definition
Previously, VAP was defined by clinical, radiographic, and microbiologic
criteria, but these signs are neither sensitive nor specific compared to
histology.14 The CDC thus convened in 2011–2012 to develop a new
approach to surveillance for mechanically ventilated patients given the
limitation of traditional VAP definitions. The CDC thus created a three-
tiered definition of VAEs (see Table 9-2).
TABLE 9-2 Three-tiered Definition for VAE from the CDC
Risk Factors
The risk of VAP is the highest in the first few days of intubation, with a
daily hazard rate of approximately 3% at day 5 of intubation, decreasing to
1% per day by day 15; cumulative risk continues to accrue for the duration
of mechanical ventilation.17
Prevention
Guidelines for prevention of VAP and other VAEs are divided based on age,
but in this chapter, the focus will remain on adults. Avoiding intubation with
noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) can be beneficial in
patients with hypercarbic or hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as well as cardiogenic congestive
heart failure. NIPPV has been shown to decrease VAP risk, shorten duration
of mechanical ventilation, decrease length of stay, and lower mortality rates,
but if used outside of these special populations, a delay in intubation may
lead to increased harm.14
While patients are on mechanical ventilation, avoidance of sedatives
such as benzodiazepines is recommended. Two randomized control trials
have shown that daily sedative interruptions decreased net sedative
exposures and reduced the average duration of mechanical ventilation by 2–
4 days.14 Daily spontaneous breathing trials also are associated with
extubation 1–2 days earlier compared to usual care.14
If possible, minimize pooling of secretions above the endotracheal tube
cuff for patients requiring intubation for longer than 48–72 hours. A meta-
analysis of 13 randomized controlled trials showed that the use of
endotracheal tubes with subglottic drainage reduced VAP rates by 55%,
duration of mechanical ventilation by a mean of 1.1 days, and intensive care
length of stay by 1.5 days.14
Elevating the head of the bed to 30–45 degrees has been evaluated with
three randomized controlled trials, and a meta-analysis pooling of these
studies did find a significant impact in decreasing VAP rates.14
Changing the ventilator circuit is only required if it is visibly soiled or
malfunctioning. Changing the circuit on fixed schedules has no impact on
VAP rates or patient outcomes.14
If high VAP rates are an issue, the following interventions have been
shown to decrease duration of mechanical ventilation, length of stay, and
mortality although there are insufficient data on their long-term
consequences:
While selective decontamination of the oropharynx with topical
antibiotics or of the oropharynx and digestive tract with a combination
of oral and parenteral antibiotics has decreased mortality rates by 14%
and 17%, respectively, in The Netherlands, this strategy is not adopted
in the US given concern for development of antibiotic resistance and
Clostridium difficile infection (CDI).14
Oral care with chlorhexidine has been studied in 16 randomized
controlled trials and 9 meta-analyses and benefits have been shown to
be most pronounced in preventing postoperative respiratory tract
infections in cardiac surgery patients.14
Four meta-analyses have found lower VAP rates in patients who
receive prophylactic probiotics, but no significant impact on mortality
has been shown.14
Approaches that are generally not recommended include silver-coated
endotracheal tubes, kinetic beds, and prone positioning. Stress ulcer
prophylaxis lowers the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, but meta-analyses
suggest that there is no impact on pneumonia rates, length of stay, or
mortality.14 Early tracheostomy has been shown to have little impact on
VAP rates.14
SURGICAL SITE INFECTIONS
Introduction
SSIs occur in 2–5% of patients undergoing inpatient surgery equaling
160,000–300,000 SSIs yearly in the US.18 SSIs are considered the most
common and costly HAI, with 60% considered to be preventable.18 SSIs
add 7–11 additional hospital days to the patient's length of stay and account
for $3.5 to $10 billion dollars annually in excess health care expenditures.18
Furthermore, patients with an SSI have 2–11 times higher risk of death,
with 77% of deaths in patients with SSI attributed directly to the
infection.18
Definition
SSIs are classified based on depth of infection (see Fig. 9-3).

Superficial incisional infection involves only the skin and
subcutaneous tissues. These infections are most commonly managed in
an outpatient setting.
Deep incisional infections involve the fascia and/or muscular layers
and are further broken down by primary or secondary infection. A deep
incision primary infection is an SSI identified in a primary incision in
a patient who has had an operation with one or more incisions. A deep
incision secondary infection is an SSI identified in a secondary
incision in a patient with more than one incision.
Organ/space infections involve any part of the body opened or
manipulated during a procedure, excluding skin incision, fascia, or
muscle layers.18 Both deep incisional and organ space infections
typically require readmission to the hospital for management.

Risk Factors
Risk factors can be separated into intrinsic patient-related characteristics
and extrinsic procedure-related characteristics.
Age, history of radiation at a surgical site, and previous history of skin
infection are all nonmodifiable patient risk factors. Modifiable risk
factors include glucose control with a goal of glycosylated hemoglobin
A1C levels of lesser than 7%, obesity, smoking cessation, avoidance of
immunosuppressive medications in the perioperative period, and
hypoalbuminemia.18
Extrinsic procedure-related risk factors include surgical scrub, skin
preparation, antimicrobial prophylaxis, avoidance of blood transfusion,
minimizing operative time and operating room traffic, and sterilization
of surgical equipment according to published guidelines while
minimizing immediate-use steam sterilization.18
MRSA is a major cause of HAIs, and patients undergoing surgery are at
risk of acquiring these infections. Colonization rates of S. aureus are
approximately 30%.19 Recently, some hospitals have started screening for
S. aureus and treating colonized patients prior to surgery as well as
selecting the appropriate antistaphylococcal agent in the preoperative
setting. A recent meta-analysis of 17 studies concluded that decolonization
strategies are effective at preventing SSIs caused by MRSA, MSSA, and
other gram-positive pathogens.18,20 Additionally, bundles that include
decontamination, decolonization, and targeted vancomycin prophylaxis
have been associated with significantly lower MRSA SSI rates.21
Prevention
Guidelines have been published for the prevention of SSIs. The Surgical
Infection Prevention (SIP) Project was established by the CMS in 2002 and
focused on delivering the most appropriate intravenous antimicrobial
prophylaxis at the optimal time, weight-based dose, and proper duration.
The Surgical Care Improvement Project (SCIP) was an expansion of SIP
created in 2003 that focused on proper hair removal, control of blood
glucose postoperatively, and maintenance of normothermia in surgical
patients. A comprehensive analysis showed that adherence to SCIP
requirements led to an 18% decrease in the odds of developing an SSI.22
CMS currently requires that hospitals submit data on seven SCIP measures
as a part of the Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting System.18
Prophylactic antibiotics, according to evidence-based standards and
guidelines, should be administered within 1 hour prior to incision (2 hours
for vancomycin and fluoroquinolones) in order to maximize tissue
concentrations while the incision is open. These antibiotics should be
discontinued within 24 hours after surgery (48 hours for cardiac procedures)
as there is no benefit to administering antimicrobial agents after closure of
the incision. Prolonged antimicrobial use has shown to confer resistance
and increase the risk of CIDs.18
Do not remove hair at the operative site unless the presence of hair will
interfere with the operation. If hair removal is necessary, clipping with
clippers are recommended as opposed to shaving with razors.
Blood glucose levels should be kept below 180 mg/dL in the 18–24
hours after anesthesia end time. More intensive postoperative glucose
control has not been shown to reduce the risk of SSI and may only lead to
higher risk of adverse outcomes.18
Normothermia is imperative during the perioperative period as even
mild degrees of hypothermia can increase SSI rates. Hypothermia may
directly impair neutrophil function or it may impair it indirectly by
triggering subcutaneous vasoconstriction and subsequent tissue hypoxia.18
Alcohol-containing 
preoperative 
skin 
preparatory 
agents 
are
recommended as they are highly bactericidal, but alcohol alone does not
have persistent activity; addition of chlorhexidine or povidone–iodine is
recommended.
Supplemental oxygen during and immediately following surgical
procedures involving mechanical ventilation can be considered as an
additional preventive measure. A meta-analysis of 5 studies concluded that
perioperative supplemental oxygen led to a relative risk reduction of 25%
for SSI.18
Education is key to implementing prevention within the hospital. If one
surgeon or one area within surgery is noted to have elevation in SSI,
providing one-to-one education of evidence-based practices has been shown
to decrease SSI rates.18
CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE
Introduction
Clostridium difficile is an important transmissible nosocomial pathogen.
CDI is the leading cause of infectious diarrhea among hospitalized
patients.23 In a recent survey of US hospitals, gastrointestinal infections
were the third most common type of HAI, of which 70.9% were attributed
to C. difficile.7 During the past decade, CDI has become more frequent,
more severe, and more refractory to treatment. Between the years 2000 and
2009, CDI rates have more than doubled, and recent studies have reported
that CDI rates have now surpassed MRSA rates in hospitals.24,25 CDI
increases hospital length of stay by 2.8–5.5 days. Attributable costs have
been estimated to be $3006 to $15,397 per episode, and US hospital costs
have been estimated to be $1.0 to $4.9 billion per year.25 The attributable
mortality of CDI is estimated to be 5–10%, leading to an estimated 14,000–
20,000 deaths each year.25
Definition
CDI is defined as a case of clinically significant diarrhea or toxic
megacolon without other known etiology that either a stool sample yields a
positive result of C. difficile toxin, pseudomembranous colitis is seen on
endoscopic examination, or pseudomembranous colitis is seen on
histopathologic examination (Table 9-4).25 A positive result of C. difficile
toxin is the most common method to identify patients with CDI. Patient
may be carriers of C. difficile, and samples should only be tested when
diarrhea is present.25
TABLE 
9-4 
Classification 
of 
CDI
Prevention
Clostridium difficile is a spore-forming bacteria, which poses challenges for
hand hygiene and environmental disinfection practices since spores are
resistant to the bactericidal effects of alcohol. Although alcohol is not
effective at removal of these spores, no clinical study has shown an increase
in CDI rates when alcohol-based hand rubs are the predominant hand
hygiene product used, nor a decrease in CDI rates if soap and water is the
predominant method for hand hygiene.25 Several controlled studies have
found that alcohol-based hand hygiene products to be ineffective at
removing C. difficile spores from the hands of volunteers. However, a more
recent study has found that most alcohol-based hand hygiene products
result in a lesser than 1 log reduction in spores despite a 60-second
handwash.25 Contamination of hands is less common when gloves are worn
before the patient encounter.
Restriction on antimicrobial use and stewardship are important in the
prevention of CDI. Fluoroquinolones have been found to be one of the
antimicrobials that are most associated with the development of CDI, but
virtually every antibiotic has been associated, including cephalosporins,
ampicillin, and clindamycin. Restriction of specific high-risk antimicrobials
has been effective in outbreak settings.25
Full barrier precautions and hand hygiene prevent indirect transmission
by health care professionals. The CDC currently recommends contact
precautions to be continued for the duration of illness and up to 48 hours
after diarrhea resolves. Patients with CDI can continue to shed spores in the
stool and contaminate the environment, but there are no data to support
extending contact isolation period beyond 48 hours after resolution of the
diarrhea as a measure to decrease CDI incidence.25 A recent ICU study
found admission to a room previously occupied by a patient with CDI to be
a risk factor for acquisition, but 90% of patients who developed CDI did not
have this risk factor.
When CDI remains higher than the institution's goal, a CDI risk
assessment should be performed, and infection prevention with contact
precautions and hand hygiene should be intensified. Rooms should be
assessed for adequacy of room cleaning. The use of chlorine (at least 500–
1000 parts per million in concentration) to disinfect the room may be
helpful in reducing CDI rates.
KEY POINTS
Strict adherence to hand hygiene is essential to decrease the
incidence of HAIs.
Limiting the duration or the complete elimination of use of
urinary catheters and CVC decreases the risk of developing
CAUTI and CLABSI.

10 Coding and Documentation
Melissa Sum and Robert J. Mahoney
CLINICAL VIGNETTE
A 33-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease presents with swelling
and erythema over her dialysis graft site for 5 months. Diagnosed with an
infected chronic thrombus, she is admitted for intravenous antibiotics. On
admission, she reports an allergy to multiple antibiotics and refuses all
medications ending in “-mycin.” She is started on cefazolin and
metronidazole. After starting this regimen, she notifies staff of a suspected
allergic reaction to the metronidazole; the documentation indicates that she
appears “well with normal vital signs and no evidence of allergic reaction
on exam.” Later that day, she is taken to the operating room for
debridement and is given intravenous gentamicin, metronidazole, and
cefazolin. In recovery, she is noted to be “yelling and scratching” and is
given famotidine, diphenhydramine, and hydroxyzine. That evening, the
patient complains of feeling unwell and requests prednisone. The request is
not documented, nor is a physician evaluation of the patient. The patient
receives diphenhydramine and prednisone, “for allergy and itching.” The
next morning, the patient is found lying across the bed, pulseless. A code
blue is called, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation is administered,
unsuccessfully. The covering physician reviews the chart and calls the
patient's family to inform them of her death.
Could improved documentation have led to better or safer care?
Can improved documentation lead to better troubleshooting of
unexpected outcomes?
INTRODUCTION
The quality of documentation in medical records has long been subject to
improvement. In William Osler's era at the end of the 19th century, house
officers worked, slept, and ate at the hospital and were expected to present
information 
to 
consultants 
directly. Accordingly, 
medical 
record
documentation often reflected only superficial aspects of the care provided.
Furthermore, Osler and other senior faculty rarely signed chart notes.1
With the complexity of modern medical care—encompassing multiple
collaborating physicians and complex testing—the medical record now
serves a dual role as a critical communication tool and as a repository of
clinical information.
Currently, the medical record is the primary means to communicate
relevant information about a patient's care to other care providers, to payors,
and to allied health professionals. Information from the record is abstracted
to determine what services were provided and to provide justification for
those services.
The medical record is also a key component of patient safety and serves
an important medicolegal function.2 Medical record documentation is
routinely used to assess the severity of illness (SOI) and the likelihood of
adverse outcomes.
Given the central role of documentation in capturing and
communicating a patient's medical course—and the ease with which
multiple providers can now access and contribute to it—high-quality
documentation is rapidly becoming synonymous with high-quality care.
PRINCIPLES 
OF 
QUALITY
DOCUMENTATION
Accuracy
Above all, clinical documentation should reflect the observations and
experiences that comprise a given patient encounter as accurately as
possible. What is documented during an encounter will likely form the basis
for future treatment decisions, making the fidelity of the record essential.
When possible, documentation should occur concurrently with the care
provided.3
Specificity
As we will see in this chapter, a significant amount of information is
abstracted from clinical documentation, including indicators of SOI,
expected mortality, and the diagnosis and management data used to bill for
services. For this reason, the findings and diagnoses in the record should be
as specific as possible. Many institutions have hired clinical documentation
improvement (CDI) personnel to collaborate with physicians to improve the
specificity of the diagnoses provided in their documentation. As the US
adopts the tenth edition of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-
10) for coding, the amount of specificity required to properly assign
diagnoses for encounters—and, theoretically, the quality of the data
extracted from documentation—is expected to increase significantly.4
Legibility
Thankfully, the increasing adoption of electronic record systems has
reduced the problem of illegible handwritten notes. Nonetheless, many
institutions continue to maintain some component of handwritten records.
As long as such handwritten notes are a part of the medical record, every
effort should be made to make these notes legible.
According to one study of attending and resident physician handwritten
records, a considerable portion of the records was illegible.5 Sixteen percent
of the written words were illegible; the complete context could be
understood in only 58% of the notes. In addition to medical errors resulting
from illegible handwritten medication orders or other documentation,
legible records are important to convey to others what has transpired over
the course of the day in this era of duty-hour regulations and increasing
patient handoffs.
Avoiding 
Duplicated 
Documentation
(“Copy/Paste”)
Many electronic record systems allow providers to copy documentation
from other days or other providers into their notes. While this affords
convenience, and perhaps more consistent documentation, it can lead to
propagation of inaccurate or outdated information.6 Furthermore, because
clinical documentation is abstracted to determine the services provided to a
given patient, duplicated documentation can lead to inaccurate—or worse,
fraudulent—billing for services.
Out of concern for overpayments provided potentially as a result of
duplicated documentation, the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services (HHS) Office of the Inspector General (OIG) announced as part of
its work plan for 2013 that it would begin reviewing clinical documentation
for evidence of “documentation practices associated with potentially
improper payments,” including duplicated documentation.7
DOCUMENTATION AS A QUALITY
COMPONENT
Quality 
Indicators/Severity 
of 
Illness/Risk 
of
Mortality
Since 1992, the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA)—now the
Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)—has focused on
improving the quality of the medical care in the US.
Instead of relying on clinicians' intuitive criteria to manage patients,
peer review organizations (PROs) utilize explicit, nationally uniform
criteria to assess patterns of care and outcomes.8 The PRO program has
derived quality indicators (QIs), which measure aspects of health care
quality using readily available hospital inpatient administrative data.
The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) has
developed four sets of QIs:
Inpatient Quality Indicators (IQIs): These are 32 items reflecting the
quality of inpatient care, including inhospital mortality rates for 7
specific medical conditions and 8 surgical procedures, utilization rates
for 11 specific procedures, and hospital-level case volume for 6
complex procedures. Each indicator is selected based on evidence that
utilization practices or mortality rates vary by institution and may
benefit from standardized observation.
Patient Safety Indicators (PSIs): These are 27 indicators of potentially
avoidable complications or other adverse events related to inpatient
care.
Prevention Quality Indicators (PQIs): These are hospital admission
rates for 14 conditions wherein admission may reflect shortfalls in
outpatient care.
Pediatric Quality Indicators (PDIs): These are 18 indicators similar to
IQIs, PQIs, or PSIs, applied to the pediatric population.
All of the foregoing QIs are derived from hospital documentation at
discharge. Originally intended for research and quality improvement
activities,9 they are now publicly available and used to derive pay-for-
performance parameters and for grading providers for tiered insurance
products.
In addition to deriving QIs, the medical record is also used to determine
other important measures. As indicated earlier in this chapter, the diagnoses
documented and procedures performed during inpatient encounters are used
to determine a key variable, the SOI. The SOI affords reviewers a
benchmark for hospital resource use and outcomes by classifying the extent
of a given patient's organ system derangement or physiologic
decompensation into categories (minor, moderate, major, or extreme). This
allows for comparison across hospitals while controlling for the acuity of
illness in their patient population.
The risk of mortality (ROM) provides a rough estimate of the likelihood
of inpatient survival for a class of patients, again controlled for the degree
of illness. Often viewed as a measure of quality, the ROM is used by
hospitals and quality organizations across the nation to perform comparison
to peer institutions while accounting for the impact of individual risk
factors, such as age and SOI. Notably, increasing the consistency and
specificity of secondary diagnosis codes has been shown to improve the
accuracy of risk-adjusted inpatient mortality rates.10
Impact on Quality of Care
While facilitating an accurate assessment of care quality, appropriate
documentation could conceivably lead to improved care quality. For
example, accurate documentation of the stage of chronic kidney disease
could render clinicians more aware of the need for medication dose
adjustments to prevent over- or underdosing. A study on wrong-site surgery
found that approximately one-third of these sentinel events were
attributable to errors that occurred in the weeks prior to surgery, including
wrong documentation and inaccurate labeling of radiologic reports.11
Another study in oncology patients showed that proper documentation of
symptoms led to improved symptom management, ultimately improving
patients' health-related quality of life.12
At the same time, few studies have examined whether improving
documentation actually leads to improved quality of care. Authors in one
study found a substantial increase in the completion of recommended
preventive care such as vaccinations and mammograms after the
implementation of an electronic medical record (EMR).13 Recent studies in
the ambulatory setting, however, suggest that outpatient records may not
accurately reflect actual provision of quality care components. In one study,
investigators assessed 12 quality measures among all eligible adult patients
in 2008 at a federally qualified health center using a commercially available
health record. They found sensitivities of electronic reporting for each
measure ranging from 46% to 98% compared to manual review of what
actually was provided. As a result, incentives intended to reward high
quality may not necessarily be given to the highest quality provider; rather,
these incentives may reward the highest quality documenters.14
One of the most important roles for clinical documentation is
communication during transitions of care; nowhere is this more evident
than at hospital discharge. Communication of a patient's hospital course to
the patient's primary care provider is a critical step in the discharge process.
Yet, in one systematic review, primary care providers had a discharge
summary at only 12–34% of postdischarge visits, and key information was
often deemed missing from the discharge summaries.15 These gaps in
communication lead to confusion for the patient and the providers and
could be a potential course of adverse events and readmissions.
The fragmentation of inpatient care also means that, increasingly,
“cross-cover physicians” get called for patients under the care of another
“primary team.” Such cross-cover care should be documented whenever a
physician is called for a significant event or a change in status. Notes need
to include key components of the clinical issue for which the physician was
called, relevant subjective and objective data, the physician's assessment
and plan, as well as required follow-up. This documented information will
be helpful in alerting the primary team that their patient experienced an
incident that required a physician's evaluation, will help the primary team
(and other teams taking care of the patient) understand the rationale for
cross-cover management decisions, and will inform the teams of any
follow-up required. A sample template for a cross-cover note is included in
Figure 10-1.
Figure 10-1 A sample template for a cross-cover note.
Revisiting the clinical vignette at the start of the chapter, it is possible
that improved documentation of the patient's symptoms could have led to a
recognition of her distress, the need to provide further evaluation, and the
opportunity to potentially adjust therapy for a possible allergic reaction—or
at least increase the level of monitoring and potentially avoid the adverse
outcome.
Litigation
Being involved in medical malpractice is one of the most traumatic
experiences any physician can face. More than 42% of physicians have
been sued over the course of their careers (American Medical Association
survey, 2010, covering years 2007 to 2008). At the same time, fewer than
8% of medical malpractice cases ever reach a jury; at the trial stage,
physicians prevail in 80–90% of the cases. According to the Indian Health
Service Risk Management Manual, “the medical record is the best device
we have to protect against malpractice claims.”16
The 
characteristics 
of 
a 
defensible 
medical 
record 
include
completeness, objectivity, consistency, and accuracy. Above all else,
documentation quality remains the most important factor in the success or
failure of most claims.17 A review showed that documentation in obstetric
malpractice cases was more often judged as substandard (13%) rather than
acceptable (2%).18 Since cases often proceed to trial years after the care
was provided, an accurate account must exist in the records from the time
of the encounter. Documentation should also include informed consent to—
or informed refusal of—care deemed medically necessary.
Although informal or “curbside” consultations (in which the consultant
may not ever see the patient or review the chart) are a frequent part of
medical practice, there is no consensus on proper documentation of such
informal consults. In general, such consultations are completely “off the
record.” Clinicians should avoid documenting the name of the colleague
providing the informal consult, or the nature of the recommendations,
unless such permission is obtained.19 Any clinician whose name is entered
in the medical record can become entangled in legal proceedings.
When asked to provide such an informal consultation, clinicians should
readily suggest formal consultation when appropriate. Finally, when
providing informal consultations, it may be advisable to provide academic,
generalizable information, rather than patient-specific advice.
DOCUMENTATION 
AS 
A
TROUBLESHOOTING TOOL
What to Document in Error/Adverse Event
Being able to learn from errors or adverse events is fundamental to prevent
them from happening in the future. While a full discussion of error
reporting and analysis is provided elsewhere (see Chapters 12 and 13),
proper error documentation is an important component of the medical
record. In all instances, one should be sure to follow institutional policy.
Completion of medical record documentation should be performed as
soon as possible after the error is discovered.20 Only the facts, not opinion
or conjecture, should be recorded in the patient's medical record. Events
should be described clearly, as well as any additional treatments given. It is
equally important to document the content of any discussions held with the
patient and/or family regarding a possible error.
Many institutions have a policy that requires filing an incident report
describing the error or adverse event in detail. Here, as in the patient's
medical record, it is prudent to avoid conclusions, opinions, conjecture, and
assignment of blame in the incident report. While most hospitals maintain
these privileged reports for use by their risk management office, these
records may be discoverable in some states.
While incident reports are important troubleshooting tools for
individual institutions, true safety improvements ultimately require broad
reporting. Interestingly, in a study conducted using national surveys, only
21% of physicians, compared to 62% of members of the public, believed
that voluntary reporting of serious medical errors to a state agency would
reduce future errors.21
To return again to the clinical vignette that started the chapter: the
patient's repeated complaints and concerns could have alerted staff to a
possible adverse reaction to medication. Documentation of a thorough
patient assessment, ongoing discussion among staff, and additional
treatment/monitoring measures provided could have afforded improved
care. Furthermore, comprehensive information about the circumstances
surrounding her death could have provided the clinician with crucial
information to provide to family members.
KEY POINTS
All aspects of the medical record must be accurate and legible.
Documentation is used to assess quality of care.
Improved documentation may lead to improved quality of care.
Proper documentation can serve as protection during litigation.

SECTION 2 Patient Safety
11 Introduction to Patient Safety
Noah Schoenberg, Emily Fondahn, and Michael Lane
CLINICAL VIGNETTE
An outbreak of norovirus has left the nursing staff at the hospital short-
handed. Healthy staff members are asked by hospital leadership to cover
additional shifts and many shifts are left understaffed. Rob, a new nurse
who recently completed his orientation to the unit, feels well and is eager to
pitch in and help his colleagues. Rob volunteered to work a double shift
even though he was exhausted after coming off of night shift. Joan, a nurse
that Rob worked with extensively during his orientation, asked if he could
help her out by giving blood pressure medications to her patient, “Jon
Smith,” since she was busy with an unstable patient. While Rob was
obtaining the medication from the Pyxis machine, he was interrupted by Dr.
Jones who had a question about the patient in room 2 and the physical
therapist who wanted to know if the patient in room 8 was stable to
participate in therapy. After the interruptions, Rob removed the medications
for Jon Smith. He was unaware that there were two patients with similar
names on the floor; one was Jon Smith, the other John Smythe. He entered
room 12 and asked the patient to state his name. The patient responded,
“John Smythe.” Rob thought it was a little strange that the patient
pronounced his name differently than Joan had called him but thought this
must be the right patient. Although he was taught in school the appropriate
steps to verify that he was administering medications to the right patient,
the nurses who oriented him to the floor had told him that all of those steps
were unnecessary and a waste of time. Rob administered the medication to
the patient and returned to taking care of his other patients. Approximately
1 hour later, John Smythe had an episode of syncope while getting out of
bed. He was found to be hypotensive. After reviewing the events, it is
discovered that the medications for meant Jon Smith where given to John
Smythe, causing the hypotension.
What factors contributed to this error?
What systems or processes could be put in place to prevent an error
like this?
INTRODUCTION
A patient in the hospital should not be harmed due to medical errors while
receiving care. However, based upon estimates from the Institute of
Medicine report, “To Err is Human,” an estimated 44,000–98,000 people
are harmed in the hospital each year.1 Every person can expect to have at
least one misdiagnosis during his or her life.2 These staggering statistics
highlight the need to evaluate and reform how health care is delivered. The
field of patient safety is a “discipline in the healthcare sector that applies
safety science methods towards the goal of achieving a trustworthy system
of healthcare delivery…it minimizes the incidence and impact of, and
maximizes recovery from, adverse events.”3 Patient safety is a relatively
new discipline in health care and focuses on preventing harm to patients.
The components of patient safety include a culture of safety to limit blame
to individual providers, redesigning systems to create high reliability,
promoting transparency and learning from medical errors, and making
health care systems accountable to eliminate preventable harm.3
Approaches to analyzing patient safety include Donabedian “Structure–
Process–Outcome” Model, Reason “Swiss Cheese” Model, Rasmussen
Model of System's Migration, and error analysis.
PATIENT SAFETY MODELS
Donabedian Structure–Process–Outcome Model
In 1966, Avedis Donabedian published a seminal paper titled “Evaluating
the Quality of Medical Care” in which he outlines a formalized approach to
patient safety and quality improvement, now known as the Structure–
Process–Outcome Model.4
Outcomes include all the effects of health care on patients or
populations, such as recovery, restoration of function, and survival.
Examining outcomes is the most natural and intuitive means of
evaluating quality since the goal of “good” health care is a positive
outcome. Any outcome is, by definition, linked to a series of actions,
which are dependent on the structure where health care is provided and
the processes by which health care is delivered.
Structure comprises the setting in which health care occurs. The
structure consists of the physical infrastructure, the staffing, the
material and supplies, and all the various support systems involved in
providing health care.5 The quality of care provided inherently
depends upon the structure in which it is provided. A flaw in the
structure can propagate, resulting in an error and potentially in a bad
outcome. In the above clinical scenario, the structure of the medical
unit requires the nurse, Joan, to divide her time among too many
patients due to understaffing. The structure creates the backbone for
the health care process and outcomes.
Process encompasses all of the actions and interventions undertaken by
the health care providers operating within the above-defined structure.
Process includes the decisions, operations, orders, and procedures that
lead to a given outcome. The process in which health care is delivered
is dependent upon the structure of the health care setting but can also
be an independent factor in patient outcomes. For example, the process
of medication administration is influenced by the structure of the unit
but has specific procedures and protocols. In the previous example, the
failure by the nurse, Rob, to confirm that the right medication was
given to the right patient would be considered a failure of process. At
times, processes can help to balance or correct shortcomings in
structure. For example, the Pyxis machine is often located in a busy
area on a medical unit, causing nurses to be frequently interrupted
while obtaining medications. Establishing a “no interruption zone”
around the Pyxis machine could have helped prevented this error by
not allowing Rob to be interrupted as he obtained the medications.
Swiss Cheese Model
James Reason proposed the Swiss Cheese Model in his 1990 paper “The
Contribution of Latent Human Failures to the Breakdown of Complex
Systems.”6 Recent human history has seen the evolution of multiple very
complex, high-risk systems, including aviation, nuclear power, and health
care, that have developed multiple safeguards to prevent bad outcomes.
Medicine, like many complex high-risk systems, is perpetually devising and
revising procedural safeguards to attempt to minimize the potential for
harm. Overlapping layers of safeguards often catch an error before harm
occurs. In the Swiss Cheese Model, multiple failures in safeguards must
happen in order for an error to reach a patient. None of the individual
failures is sufficient to cause harm; multiple failures must occur along the
system safeguards.6 The model's name arises from the analogy that each
barrier to a bad outcome is akin to a slice of Swiss cheese, with the holes in
the cheese being analogous to potential errors, circumstances, or events that
could overcome that particular barrier. If a sufficient number of holes line
up in a series of slices of cheese, a bad outcome could occur (Fig. 11-1).
Figure 11-1 Reason “Swiss Cheese” Model. (From Reason J. Human error:
models and management. BMJ. 2000;320:768–70.)
In the opening vignette, multiple safeguards designed to prevent
incorrect medication administration had to fail. The multiple holes in the
Swiss cheese included having two patients with very similar names, lack of
following the policy for medication administration, understaffing of the unit
due to a norovirus outbreak, and multiple interruptions while retrieving the
medication. A combination of unusual circumstances, deliberate choices,
and unintentional errors led to an adverse event. This example demonstrates
that despite the engineering of multiple procedural safeguards designed
within a system, the correct alignment of system failures can overcome
these barriers, potentially leading to patient harm.
The Human Component of Patient Safety
A key component of any model of patient safety must take into account the
human component of a system. A series of high-profile accidents, including
the Chernobyl reactor meltdown and the Zeebrugge ferry incident,
highlighted the human component of safety. In both these examples,
humans deliberately drifted away from standard operating procedure.
Rasmussen describes the human tendency to drift toward the minimal
acceptable safety margin. Rasmussen states there is “a natural migration of
activities toward the boundary of acceptable performance.”7 Many factors
may cause humans to cut procedural corners.
Pressure exists to increase productivity and decrease cost. Completing
the appropriate steps of medication administration takes more time
than simply giving the medication. The time spent on medication
administration means there is less time for other work to be completed.
As humans frequently perform routine tasks, habit and memory are
often substituted for knowledge-based decision making. As individuals
become more comfortable completing a task, they have a decrease in
analytic thought and increased laxity in adherence to precise
procedure.
A person who does not follow the policy will usually not see patient
harm. Individuals may not be aware of the potential for harm because
subsequent safeguards catch any errors before they reach the patient.
The fact that harm does not occur each time the individual deviates
from standard practice may reinforce the behavior.7 As multiple
individuals within a system or process begin to stray from established
practices, the entire system slowly becomes increasingly unsafe until
an accident or bad outcome occurs that forces a re-evaluation and
realignment of the general safety practices.7 Amalberti et al. have
applied Rasmussen's ideas to the tendency to drift toward unsafe
practices over time in medicine (Fig. 11-2).8
Figure 11-2 The tendency to drift toward unsafe practices over time in
medicine. (From Amalberti R, et al. Violations and migrations in
health care: a framework for understanding and management. Qual Saf
Health Care. 2006;15:i66–71.)
“Legal zone” is where practices begin and all rules are followed.
“Illegal–normal zone” is where minor variations in safety practices
occur, and adaption is not only tolerated but sometimes encouraged
depending upon the circumstance. Migration is due to pressure for
greater performance (horizontal axis) and personal gain (vertical axis).
Borderline tolerated conditions of use (BTCUs) are violations that are
considered to provide the maximum benefit for the minimum and
accepted probability of harm. On the medical unit in the clinical
vignette, staff believed that not following the protocol for medication
administration was accepted and encouraged to increase productivity
and the probability of harm to the patient was low.
“Illegal–illegal zone” where safety practices become extreme and most
practices 
are 
considered 
“forbidden” 
under 
essentially 
all
circumstances. The boundary between “illegal–normal” and “illegal–
illegal” is where close calls occur. The “illegal–illegal” territory is
where the majority of accidents and bad outcomes occur.
A commonly used analogy is how most individuals follow the speed
limit. If the speed limit is 30 miles per hour, few people drive in the
legal zone of <30 miles per hour under normal circumstances. Most
people drive in the illegal–normal speed of 30–40 miles per hour.
People driving above 45 miles per hour are considered in the illegal–
illegal category.
In the medical field, long work hours, large patient care burdens, and
immense financial pressures provide a perfect mix of conditions to promote
migration toward minimal acceptable safety practices. This erosion was
examined more closely in the field of anesthesia in a 2010 paper looking at
anesthesia practices in the operating room (OR).9 The authors noted that
there are two different types of perceived safety regulations: “need-to-
follow” and “nice-to-follow.” They found that failure to observe “nice-to-
follow” rules frequently leads to violations of “need-to-follow” rules,
endangering patients and leading to further accidents and bad outcomes.
ERROR DEFINITIONS
Types of Errors
Many different terms are often used to describe a bad outcome. Clarifying
these terms is important both to prevent misunderstanding and to facilitate
more efficient communication. Using the correct terminology is crucial to
communicate the etiology of the error and nature of the outcome. When
discussing bad outcomes, one can describe it as an adverse event, a near
miss, or simply as an error. These terms are not interchangeable.
An adverse event implies a bad outcome due to medical management
that could be, but is not necessarily, the result of a mistake or flaw in
the system. If a patient with a known penicillin allergy receives
amoxicillin because no one ever asked about her allergies, that would
be an adverse event. An adverse event is also if a penicillin-naive
patient has an allergic reaction to an amoxicillin; there is no way to
foresee and prevent an allergic reaction. The term does not imply
causation, merely an undesirable outcome due to interaction with the
medical system.
A bad outcome is an undesirable outcome due to a disease process.10 A
patient with septic shock who dies despite receiving appropriate
antibiotics and medical therapy had a bad outcome, not an adverse
event.
An error means an unintended event or a mistake. An error does not
necessarily imply outcome. An error can be caught and corrected
before reaching the patient, can reach the patient but not cause harm,
or can directly lead to a bad outcome for a patient. Regardless of
whether or not the patient with the penicillin allergy actually receives
the medication, the act of prescribing a medication to a patient with a
known allergy is an error. The prevention of errors is a central focus of
the field of patient safety and one of the driving forces behind the
evolution of new safeguards and precautions.
A near miss is an error without a subsequent adverse event. If the
patient with the penicillin allergy is prescribed amoxicillin, but the
nurse notices the error prior to giving the medication and alerts the
physician, who cancels the order and prescribes a new medication, that
is classified as a near miss. Near misses are difficult to track and
address and are some of the most frequent errors. In a complex system
with multiple redundant safeguards, much of the design of the system
is intended to create near misses in lieu of adverse events. However,
by their very nature, they are less noticeable and thus harder to track.
In addition, there is an inherent reluctance by health care workers to
report the event, due to either embarrassment by the individual who
made the error or concern by the individual who caught the near miss
that they might get someone else in trouble. A tendency exists to see
near misses as “no big deal” since an adverse event actually occurred.
As a result, near misses, though a frequent product of a well-designed
series of safeguards, are often underreported and obscure.
Classification of Human Behavior
A critical aspect of evaluating an error or adverse event lies in analyzing the
intentions underlying the behavior that lead to the error. Though there is
increasing emphasis on a Just Culture in medicine, in which individuals are
not held solely responsible for errors, individuals are still responsible for
their actions. There are three different categories into which individual
actions leading to an error can fall: human error, at-risk behavior, and
reckless behavior. The crucial difference between each category is the
awareness of the individual regarding the risk inherent in their actions and
their choices regarding how to proceed. Evaluating the individual's
intentions is a critical step in event analysis to identify system changes to
prevent similar errors.
Reckless behavior, or a deliberate disregard of risk, is the easiest to
define 
and 
the 
category 
most 
clearly 
requiring 
individual
consequences. Most commonly, this behavior occurs when someone,
despite knowing the risks of their behavior, chooses to ignore
safeguards and proceed with their actions, deliberately putting patients
and coworkers at risk. This behavior leaves the individual culpable and
requires that the individual's choices and behavior be explicitly
addressed in rectifying the situation. Designing safeguards against
consciously reckless behavior is very difficult.
At-risk behavior involves a person putting a patient or coworker at risk
through unsafe practices, without necessarily realizing the situation is
unsafe. This behavior usually occurs due to an effort to save time or
improve efficiency, thereby accidently leading to an unsafe situation. A
nurse drawing blood to match for a transfusion and not immediately
labeling the blood per policy is engaging in at-risk behavior. The
distinction between reckless behavior and at-risk behavior revolves
around that fact that with reckless behavior, the individual deliberately
places another at risk through their actions, but in at-risk behavior,
unsafe actions are taken without awareness of the risk involved. The
individual remains culpable, however, as they are nonetheless
engaging in unsafe behavior. Prevention of at-risk behavior frequently
involves training in appropriate safety practices and sufficient
oversight to ensure practices and policies are followed.
Simple human error involves an individual taking action they believe
to be safe, which nonetheless can result in a bad outcome. Fatigue,
miscalculation, and lack of attention often underlie these types of
errors. These errors include an accidental contamination of a sterile
field, mislabeling of a specimen, wrong-side surgery, or even just
ordering the wrong dose of a medication. Many of the system
safeguards and redundancies focus on attempting to prevent or correct
human error. Witnessed blood draws, procedural checklists, and
surgical site marking are common safety practices intended to prevent
human error. Of note, the category of human error does not include
mechanical or technical errors. An intra-venous pump breaking, an
incorrect lab result, or a computer glitch would not be counted as
human errors given that they are not directly due to human actions. A
slip of the hand, a mental miscalculation, and a failure of human
memory are inherent dangers in any system that involves a human
component and the potential for error implicit in the human presence
that drives much of the development of the field of patient safety.
Active Failures and Latent Conditions
In his paper proposing the Swiss cheese model, Reason notes that the
majority of failures leading to an adverse event are human in nature and are
frequently present long before the actual event occurs. He states that prior
to an adverse outcome occurring, two different types of errors can occur:
active failures and latent conditions.6
An active failure consists of “those errors and violations having an
immediate adverse effect.” Active failures are events that usually occur
on the “front line” (in the OR, the patient's bedside, etc.) that directly
lead to adverse events.
A latent condition includes “decision or actions, the damaging
consequences of which may lie dormant for a long time, only
becoming evident which they combine with local triggering factors” to
create an adverse event. Latent failures are errors or mistakes that set
up conditions for failure.
Most often, an adverse event depends upon both types of events
occurring. A surgeon operating on the wrong arm is an active failure.
However, this active failure depends upon a latent condition: the hospital
not having a policy regarding advance labeling of the appropriate limb. In
the majority of highly complex systems with multiple safeguards, the only
way the “Swiss Cheese holes” all line up is for a latent condition (or several
of them) to prepare a situation that is triggered by an active failure.
CONCLUSION
In the opening vignette, a patient was harmed from a preventable medical
error due to receiving the wrong medications. Yet, patients safely receive
medications in the hospital every day. So what happened to this particular
patient? What can be done about it? Using the ideas and patient safety
modeling systems outlined in this chapter, let us look back at the events to
decipher what went wrong. The structure of the medical unit and the
process of medication administration led to the bad outcome. The policies
and procedure were not followed due to the natural tendency to drift toward
the minimal safety standards. An active failure by a tired, overworked nurse
aligned with the multiple latent conditions allowed the error to reach the
patient. The patient safety models presented in this chapter help us analyze
and classify this error and begin redesigning systems to eliminate
preventable harm to patients.
KEY POINTS
There are often multiple safeguards in place to prevent errors
from reaching patients and causing harm. However, when all the
holes in the “Swiss Cheese” align, errors may reach patients.
Although errors have the potential to cause harm, they are not all
due to negligent behavior.
Both active failures and latent conditions may align to result in
patient harm.

CLINICAL VIGNETTE
Mrs. M, a 56-year-old woman with hypertension, presented to the hospital
with a complaint of black, tarry stools. She was found to be anemic and
admitted for evaluation of gastrointestinal bleeding. She was transferred to
a semiprivate room, hospital bed A, which was closest to the patient room
door. Her admitting physician ordered a type and screen and crossmatched
2 units of packed red blood cells. The patient noted that hospital bed B,
which was closest to the window with a garden view, was vacant and
requested the nurse to transfer her to bed B. The nurse agreed to move the
patient from bed A to bed B. That evening, the unit had several new patients
that arrived simultaneously, and the nurse for Mrs. M forgot to notify
admitting to change her location in the hospital computer order entry
system. In addition, the nurse caring for Mrs. M was on her 15th hour of
working because she had agreed to work an extra 6-hour shift for double
pay. In the meantime, transporters of a new patient with dementia arrived to
the floor and assumed that the empty bed A was for the new patient.
Overnight, the patient care technician drew blood on the wrong patient in
bed A, which was not Mrs. M, but still had Mrs. M's name in the computer.
The technician did not follow protocol of checking the patient's
identification prior to drawing blood. Later that night, the nurse for Mrs. M
realized she had forgotten to notify admitting of the room change and called
admitting to correct the room assignment. The nurse for Mrs. M proceeded
with the blood transfusion, which was unfortunately crossmatched for the
other patient's blood. Mrs. M had a severe transfusion reaction and required
subsequent treatment in an intensive care unit.
How should we address this adverse event in a culture of safety?
How can the patient safety culture be assessed on this inpatient unit?
How can information about this event be disseminated to prevent
future, similar events from occurring?
INTRODUCTION
Health care leaders today are challenged to develop and support an
infrastructure based on a foundation centered on a culture of safety in their
acute care settings. In 1983, the fundamentals of safety culture were defined
by Uttal as “shared values (what is important) and beliefs (how things
work) that interact with an organization's structures and control systems to
produce behavioral norms (the way we do things around here).”1 The safety
culture in acute care settings in health care has since been described in this
manner as “the norms, practices, values, and beliefs of the people working
in a given unit, department, hospital, or hospital system.”2,3 According to
James Reason, known for his work on human error, “safety cultures evolve
gradually in response to local conditions, past events, the character of the
leadership and the mood of the workforce.”4 Positioning these parts
strategically in order to establish a safety culture in health care can prove to
be challenging. Many have suggested that organizations need to establish
attitudes, behaviors, and practices that are engrained as a “new normal”
structured in a way to prevent errors.5
Developing a safety culture involves acquiring insight on the
perceptions of frontline workers and on multifaceted areas such as
teamwork, accepted behaviors, job satisfaction, leadership, stress
recognition, availability of resources, learning environment, error reporting,
feedback, and communication in their work environment.4 The Agency for
Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), the national federal agency with
the goal of improving safety and quality through research and practice
implementation, has identified four key features in health care patient safety
culture. These features include recognition of high-risk activities to obtain
reliable operations, presence of blame-free environments in reporting errors
or near misses, practicing collaboratively to identify solutions to safety
problems, and having leadership commitment to address patient safety
concerns.5 AHRQ has defined the safety culture of an organization as “the
product 
of 
individual 
and 
group 
values, 
attitudes, 
perceptions,
competencies, and patterns of behavior that determine the commitment to,
and the style and proficiency of, an organization's health and safety
management.”6
A weak safety culture is exemplified by health care workers who do not
communicate; fail to use safety policies, procedures, or tools; and refrain
from reporting mistakes due to a “blame and shame” phenomenon.3
Institutions with strong health care safety cultures have highly reliable,
engaged, health care workers who communicate effectively, have strong
teamwork perceptions, and respond to errors by utilizing reporting systems
and root cause analysis, which foster a continuous learning environment
from mistakes and near misses.
ESTABLISHING 
A 
“JUST
CULTURE”
On May 24, 2001, Dr. Lucian Leape, a professor at the Harvard School of
Public Health, prepared a statement for the Senate Committee on Health,
revealing that “identifying systems failures and correcting them will not
occur if workers are punished for making errors. Safe industries create a
non-punitive environment, and also pay attention to factors that affect
performance, such as hours and work loads, work conditions, and team
relationships, an agenda that health care must now address.”7 Developing a
safety culture, which learns and improves by openly identifying and
examining its own strengths and weaknesses, is a priority in preventing
errors in health care. However, the environment in which this occurs must
be 
nonthreatening 
and 
nonpunitive 
but 
balanced 
with 
personal
accountability.8 The culture must also be engaged in a degree of
professionalism with codes of conduct that expect mutual respect and
integrity and address disruptive and inappropriate behaviors nonconducive
to learning or working.9
A pioneer in Just Culture, David Marx, a US attorney and engineer,
focuses his safety culture model on establishing open reporting and
accountability as crucial elements in improving patient outcomes.10 When
medical errors occur, personal accountability constitutes a key role in
respecting a Just Culture (see Chapter 11 for more information about
classification of human behavior). According to Marx, accountability for
errors can be divided into:
1. Human or inadvertent error 2. Errors due to at-risk behavioral choices 3.
Errors due to conscious reckless behavior
Human error, in this model, requires careful examination of systems,
processes, training, and design. When behavioral choices play a role in
errors, managing positive and negative incentives and increasing situational
awareness must be examined. However, when conscious, reckless behavior
is involved, corrective disciplinary actions must be pursued. Disciplinary
models can be based on rules, outcomes, or risks.10 Some consider a Just
Culture to be established when an organization has balanced the fine line of
acceptable and unacceptable behaviors, with a cushion of psychological
safety in reporting errors to improve systems and decrease patient harm.11
TOOLS FOR ASSESSING PATIENT
SAFETY CULTURE
Measuring and analyzing the patient safety culture in health care settings
plays an important role because it identifies strengths and weaknesses of
organizations in regard to patient safety issues. Assessment of a safety
culture allows institutions to establish a reference point for baseline data
before interventions are started, prioritization of areas for patient safety
efforts, and monitoring of trends or changes in patient safety culture after
interventions. Several tools have been developed to help organizations
measure patient safety culture.
AHRQ 
SURVEYS 
ON 
PATIENT
SAFETY CULTURE
In 2004, AHRQ developed a tool known as the Hospital Survey on Patient
Safety (HSOPS) Culture, which explored 12 components of safety
culture12:
1. Communication openness 2. Feedback and communication about error
3. Frequency of events reported 4. Handoffs and transitions 5.
Management support for patient safety 6. Nonpunitive response to
error 7. Organizational learning—continuous improvement 8. Overall
perceptions of patient safety 9. Staffing
10. Supervisor/manager expectations and actions promoting safety 11.
Teamwork across units 12. Teamwork within units
In order for hospitals to compare their patient safety culture with other
organizations, AHRQ established a database in 2006 from over 382 US
hospitals who volunteered and over 108,621 hospital staff data. In 2007,
AHRQ first published their results. This was subsequently updated in the
HSOPS Culture: 2008 Comparative Database Report, which included over
519 hospitals and 160,176 hospital staff respondent.13 This database has
allowed hospitals to compare their patient safety culture survey results with
each other and has enabled the monitoring of trends in patient safety culture
over time within and between institutions.
Establishing a patient safety culture is not unique to hospitals and acute
care settings. Ambulatory settings and medical offices are also prone to
medical errors and preventable adverse events.14 Creating a safety culture
in medical offices has grown widespread interest. In 2009, AHRQ released
the Medical Office Survey on Patient Safety Culture.15 Similar to the
HSOPS, the Medical Office Survey on Patient Safety Culture examines 13
areas that include the following:
1. List of patient safety and quality issues 2. Teamwork
3. Information exchange with other settings 4. Work pressure and pace 5.
Staff training
6. Office processes and standardization 7. Communication openness 8.
Patient care tracking/follow-up 9. Communication about error 10.
Leadership support for patient safety 11. Organizational learning 12.
Overall perceptions of patient safety and quality 13. Overall ratings on
quality and patient safety
In 2010, AHRQ developed a database of their results in patient safety
culture in medical offices. Updated in 2012, this database included over 234
US medical offices and over 23,679 medical staff respondents. In addition
to hospital and medical office settings, AHRQ has also developed patient
safety culture assessment tools tailored for nursing homes and pharmacies
supporting the goal of improving the patient safety culture in other health
care settings.16,17
PATIENT SAFETY CLIMATES AND
SAFETY 
ATTITUDES
QUESTIONNAIRES
Within a safety culture, unique patient safety climates exist, comprising of
multiple components that are specific to each unit or clinical area.
Measurements of attitudes and beliefs relevant to patient safety issues have
grown with widespread interest. The Safety Attitudes Questionnaire (SAQ),
funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and AHRQ, was
developed in 2006 by Bryan Sexton, Eric Thomas, and Bob Helmreich.18
Modifications of the SAQ and variations of safety climate surveys are
frequently utilized in organizations to provide a snapshot representation of
perceptions of safety culture in individual areas. Versions of the SAQ have
been adapted for use in operating rooms, inpatient settings, ambulatory
outpatient settings, and intensive care units. Modifications of these types of
questionnaires often target central themes surrounding patient safety, such
as teamwork, stress recognition, communication, resources, discipline,
working conditions, job satisfaction, organization, and leadership. Results
of these questionnaires are often utilized to display strengths and
weaknesses of health care units in specific areas. These areas can then be a
focus for future interventions to improve patient safety climates.
CREATING 
A 
CULTURE 
OF
SAFETY 
THROUGH 
ERROR
REPORTING
Implementation and Use of Error Reporting
Systems
The Institute of Medicine (IOM) in 1999 called for the implementation of
error reporting systems in health care organizations.19 At that time, eight
states had mandatory adverse event reporting systems in place, the earliest
being South Carolina in 1976. The Joint Commission on Accreditation of
Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) (now called the Joint Commission)
created a sentinel event system in 1996 for voluntary reporting of what the
commission defined as sentinel events. The purpose of this system was for
member organizations to submit not only the details of the event itself but
also the root cause analysis performed and the response undertaken by the
health care organization. Other reporting systems in place at that time
included the medication errors reporting (MER) program started by the
Institute for Safe Medication Programs in 1975, which shared medication
error reports with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and
pharmaceutical companies. These reporting systems were in many ways
limited. The state adverse reporting systems and the JCAHO sentinel event
system focused mostly on events that led to significant harm or death.
Programs like MER looked at medication errors and may not have captured
errors in other aspects of health care delivery system. None of these
reporting systems attempted to address the more common no harm or near
miss events, which, although no patient harm occurred, may actually better
highlight the vulnerabilities in the health care delivery system.
The IOM described the dual roles envisioned for error reporting
systems: to hold providers accountable for performance and to improve
patient safety through learning from errors. Two tiers of error reporting
systems were proposed. Mandatory reporting systems were envisioned to
hold providers accountable for performance by focusing on errors that lead
to serious injuries or death. These systems were to be run by state
regulatory programs with the power to investigate specific cases and, if
deemed appropriate, levy penalties or fines. The model for these systems
was the state mandatory adverse event reporting systems already in place.
The goals of such a reporting system were to create a level of protection for
patients and, by holding health care organizations accountable for their
actions, incentivize health care organizations to invest in patient safety and
quality improvement efforts.
The Office of Inspector General (OIG) for Health and Human Services
sought to identify states with adverse event reporting systems and how this
information was utilized by the states.20 By 2008, 26 states had hospital
adverse reporting systems, although a 27th state has implemented an
adverse event reporting system in the interim. In their report, the OIG noted
a large disparity in the adverse events each state required to be reported. For
example, the types of adverse events requiring reporting varied based upon
the level of resultant harm to the patient. All states listed at least one
adverse event that leads to death listed as a reportable event. However, only
one state (Pennsylvania) required certain near misses as reportable adverse
events. Similarly, adverse events associated with medical devices not
functioning as intended are reportable in some states if death, disability, or
loss of body part occurs but in other states are only reportable if death
occurs. Only three states used a standardized list of serious reportable
events such as one generated by the National Quality Forum,21 a nonprofit
public service organization that endorses the use of standardized health care
performance measures. Although the creation of state mandatory reporting
systems in at least half of the states is a marked improvement over the
absence of such reporting systems, the disparity by state of what
information is collected makes aggregating such data into national trends
exceedingly difficult. The IOM recognized this problem, calling for a
standardized report format with basic required elements such as how the
event was discovered, details of the adverse event itself, contributing
factors, any causal analysis, and the recommendations derived from this
analysis.22 Such a standardized report would also require the generation of a
standardized taxonomy for adverse events to allow for classification and
comparison of similar events. However, such standardization would allow
for national trends to be compiled and analyzed.
Voluntary reporting systems were envisioned by the IOM to act as a
complement to mandatory reporting systems to drive improvements in
patient safety and quality care. Such error reporting systems would attempt
to capture all errors, regardless of severity of harm, as well as near misses
that were corrected before any harm occurred to the patient. Through the
gathering of such information from multiple, frontline reporters, potential
trends or persistent vulnerabilities in health care delivery would hopefully
become apparent. One potential model cited by the IOM was the Aviation
Safety Reporting System operated by National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA) for the aviation industry.23 This system collects
incident reports submitted confidentially about aircraft operations, which
could affect safety. All incident reports are indexed in a database where the
identifier information is kept anonymous and is analyzed by a group of
experts. If further expert analysis identifies potential hazards or possible
system improvements, this information is disseminated to the aviation
industry through bulletins and monthly safety publications. Currently, this
model is used in health care by the Veteran's Administration through the
Patient Safety Reporting System (PSRS).
Regardless of whether states have adverse event reporting systems,
hospitals are required by Federal regulation to maintain a Quality
Assessment and Performance Improvement Program as a condition of
participation in Medicare.24 Within this code, hospitals must measure
quality indicators, including adverse patient events, and use this data to
identify areas for improvement in safety and quality of care. Nearly all
hospitals have an internal incident reporting system accessible by all
hospital personnel in which adverse events can be reported. However, the
capabilities and utilization of these systems vary, with only 79% able to
document severity of harm to patient, 58% able to collect patient's medical
history, and only 47% allowing for anonymous reporting.25
Barriers to Error Reporting
Unfortunately, multiple studies have highlighted the many barriers to error
reporting. Perceived barriers to error reporting include lack of knowledge
about the reporting system, time involved in reporting an error, fear of
reprisal/culture of blame, and the belief that there was no need to report
errors that cause no harm to the patient.26 A study performed in South
Australia noted these barriers and also highlighted that lack of feedback
from errors that were reported was a major deterrent from further error
reporting.27 The majority of current error reporting is being done by nursing
and not by physicians, therapists, or other members of the health care team.
In one survey, 96% of the hospitals involved stated that nursing generated
most to all of the incident reports with only 2% from physicians in training
and 1% from attending physicians.25 Such barriers, whether real or
perceived, lead to substantial underreporting of adverse events, errors, or
near misses.
The OIG in a follow-up report further quantified the problem of
underreporting of adverse events in error reporting systems.28 The OIG
performed a chart review of 780 Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized in the
month of October 2008 and identified 293 adverse events in 189 hospitals
with internal error reporting systems. The review found that of these events,
only 35 (14%) were actually captured by the hospital's incident reporting
system. The most common reasons given for why the vast majority of
adverse events were not reported was that hospital staff did not perceive the
events as reportable, usually due to lack of perceived error or the belief that
the event was an expected side effect of treatment. When the adverse events
were then compared to data obtained by state mandatory reporting systems,
it was found that 60% of the events occurred in states with mandatory
reporting systems, only 12% met state reporting requirements, and that only
three total events (1%) of all events were actually reported to the state.29 All
three events were reported in Pennsylvania, which as noted earlier requires
reporting of certain events regardless of the severity of patient harm.
Therefore, this study concluded that only 1% of adverse events are actually
being captured by mandatory state reporting, showing that health care still
has a large deficiency in capturing all adverse events, much less no harm
events or near misses.
Ideally, error reporting systems would be ubiquitous in all health care
settings. A vigorous collection of error reporting would allow organizations
to learn from experience. There must be a supportive, nonpunitive
environment that encourages the reporting of adverse events, errors, or near
misses. Although a Just Culture should reduce the fear of reprisal,
anonymous submissions should be allowed to ensure a supportive
environment and encourage error reporting. The reporting system must
protect confidentiality not only of the patients but also of the reporters. The
reporting would come from a range of staff to ensure that all health care
providers are invested in the process and that multiple viewpoints are being
observed within the health care organization. Finally, there must be prompt
feedback, relevant expert analysis, and distribution of lessons learned to
encourage further error reporting from frontline providers. Dr. Charles
Billings, one of the founders from NASA of the Aviation Safety Reporting
System, summarized it thusly when he stated the best error reporting
systems are safe (nonpunitive), simple (easy to report), and worthwhile
(expert analysis with timely feedback and dissemination).30
LEARNING FROM ERRORS
Transparency
As described in the previous section, one must report errors to learn from
errors. From the earliest stages of medical training, we are asked to learn
from our experiences, which include learning from our mistakes. Through
openness in reporting, we can also learn from errors performed by others
before we repeat such mistakes in our patients. However, this principle of
transparency also requires us to admit fallibility, which is not easy in the
setting of medical care. Transparency calls for health care providers to
factually report errors, both to error reporting systems as well as to patients.
Quality improvement through full analysis of any error benefits from full
transparency from the reporter. Although anonymous reporting should be
allowed in a supportive environment, that same anonymity does not allow
for further context to be obtained from the reporter in the form of follow-up
questions. Anonymity also precludes providing feedback to the reporter.
Full transparency from the initial reporter about the adverse event,
corresponding situation, and the error that occurred is vital in determining
the 
root 
causes 
for 
the 
adverse 
event. 
Transparency 
through
acknowledgement of errors to the patient also fulfills the need to establish
trust with the health care consumers.
Transparency also may lie in conflict with liability, another perceived
barrier to voluntary reporting of error. Health care providers are often
concerned that error reporting could be utilized in discovery in civil liability
cases. Full disclosure of errors to patients was perceived as an invitation to
further malpractice claims, although such an increase in claims has not been
demonstrated at health care organizations that have implemented full
disclosure.31 In the absence of a Just Culture, concerns for sanctions, loss of
reputation, and loss of livelihood also stood in the way of full
transparency.32
In an attempt to address these issues, the US Congress passed the
Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act (PSQIA) in 2005. The PSQIA
defined data involved in patient safety programs as patient safety work
products, which would be granted legal protections from discovery. The Act
also authorized the Agency of Healthcare Research and Quality to create
patient safety organizations (PSO), external agencies that would receive and
analyze error reporting data from health care organizations. The PSO could
then disseminate its findings throughout health care to drive quality
improvement, similar to the role played by the Aviation Safety Reporting
System. Of note, the legal protections for patient safety work products
(PSWP) were specifically for data reported to PSO; data utilized for internal
use would not fall under PSQIA but may fall under state rules of peer
review.33
The establishment of PSO with legally protected patient safety work
product may allow for the greater transparency needed for the creation of
national databases of error reporting and analysis. Certified PSO could
analyze error reporting from multiple health care organizations and
potentially identify common system weaknesses present throughout health
care. The ability to share PSWP with external organizations without fear of
sanction may encourage more comprehensive error reporting. Finally, the
ability to widely disseminate the findings from subsequent adverse event
analysis would ideally keep health care organizations from repeating such
errors before they occur at their facility.
Morbidity and Mortality Conference
Morbidity and mortality (M&M) conferences are one important setting for
learning from adverse events. One of the earliest proponents of learning
from patient outcomes was Dr. Ernest Codman, who in the early 20th
century was a strong proponent of “The End Result System.” In this system,
all surgical patients upon entry into the operating room would have a card
created upon which would be documented the initial diagnosis, operative
details, postoperative diagnosis, and immediate complications. The cards
would then be revisited annually with updates given to assess the “end
result” from each surgery. If the desired end result was not achieved, the
case was further analyzed to determine the causes and possible errors that
led to the nonoptimal end result.34 The “End Result System” was one of the
first recorded surgical systems to use patient outcomes to further drive
physician education and quality improvement.
The most immediate precursor to the modern M&M conference was the
Anesthesia Mortality Committee (later renamed the Anesthesia Study
Commission) created in 1935 in Philadelphia.35 This group was made up of
area surgeons, anesthesiologists, and internists who solicited reports of any
mortalities that occurred in the county resulting from anesthesia. Monthly
open meetings were held at which all attending physicians, residents, and
interns were invited to attend. The commission chairman would present to
the group cases selected for review, and an open discussion would then
occur under the guidance of the chairman. After this discussion was held,
the commission would vote on whether the mortality was preventable and,
if so, what factors were involved that may have contributed to the adverse
event. The findings of the commission were recorded by a secretary, and
public reports were generated. Also, the physicians present would be
encouraged to report back to their home institutions the findings generated
at these meetings to further disseminate the findings of the commission.
The morbidity and mortality conference has been a requirement of the
Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) for
accredited training programs since 1983.36 Recent surveys in internal
medicine and surgical residency programs reveal that morbidity and
mortality conference is practically ubiquitous in residency training, with the
majority of internal medicine programs holding M&M or quality
improvement conference at least monthly and almost all surgical programs
conducting M&M conference weekly.37,38 These conferences are almost
universally described as similar to the format originally created by the
Anesthesia Study Commission: cases are presented to the group for review,
an open discussion is held among attending physicians and trainees, and
conference attendees attempt to learn from errors and adverse events.
Morbidity and mortality conference attendees uniformly rank highly the
perceived educational value of the conference, highlighted by one survey of
surgical trainees in which 80% of those surveyed stated that they would
continue to attend M&M conference even if attendance was no longer
mandatory.38
However, these surveys also demonstrate potential areas of
improvement in the morbidity and mortality conference. One survey of
internal medicine M&M conference attendees noted the rationale for case
selection is not uniform, with less than half of selected cases actually
addressing unexpected morbidity or mortality.37 Presentation format and
discussion practices are neither uniform nor standardized, with many
programs allotting <10 minutes for open discussion.39 The persistent barrier
of underreporting has also been shown in case selection, with one study
revealing that postdischarge review by a trained nurse–reviewer captured
twice as many cases with mortality and over four times as many cases with
morbidity than identified and presented at that institution's M&M
conference.40 Finally, despite the call for a supportive, Just Culture, resident
physicians still cite more openness and less defensiveness/blame as the top
improvement needed in morbidity and mortality conference.36
A number of studies have attempted to address these shortcomings. As
noted, one method to address underreporting is through a trained nurse–
reviewer to evaluate for morbidity and mortality through chart review,
computerized hospital diagnosis coding, and follow-up with patients
through letters and phone calls.40 In another study, all surgical patients had
a potential complications form placed into the chart on admission. During
the course of the hospitalization, any complications that occurred were to be
immediately documented on this form. Follow-up was also performed with
all patients at 6 weeks to capture complications up to 30 days postdischarge.
Through this method, a 10% increase in mortality and 106% increase in
morbidities were captured for review.41
Regarding uniformity of presentation, one study evaluated the benefit
of a standardized format to M&M conference.42 In this study, M&M
presenters were asked to utilize a presentation format adapted from SBAR
(Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendations). Specifically, all
case presentations were now broken down by Situation (admitting
diagnosis, operative procedure, adverse outcome), Background (patient
history, procedural detail, hospital course, recognition and management of
complication), Assessment (error analysis, root cause analysis), and
Recommendations (areas for improvement, learning points). Pre- and
postintervention outcomes measured were user satisfaction, presentation
quality, and educational outcomes. All measures improved postintervention,
but most interesting was the significant improvement in educational
outcomes based upon performance on a multiple-choice test given
postconference. In another study of internal medicine M&M conferences, a
“systems audit” was created to give the discussant a framework with which
to review and analyze each case.43 The systems audit required (1) all
documentation be reviewed, (2) interviews performed with all stakeholders,
(3) performance of a root cause analysis using a quality improvement tool,
(4) calculation of overcall cost of care and cost of adverse outcomes, (5)
identification of systems issues, and (6) proposal of system improvements
and prioritization of implementation. Through this audit, resident awareness
of systems-based practice increased and multiple system interventions were
proposed and implemented within the institution.43 Studies such as these
show the educational value and systems improvement potential of
morbidity and mortality conference. These studies also highlight the need
for standardized formats and formal guidelines to the required elements of
morbidity and mortality conference.
In summary, morbidity and mortality conferences are a vital component
to learning from errors, especially in the realm of physician education. A
standardized format may ensure that the educational value is maximized.
Formal guidelines on the goals of M&M conference should be created. At a
minimum, M&M conference should identify adverse events, generate open
and blameless discussion of how errors occur, and attempt to identify the
root causes for such error. The lessons learned should be subsequently
disseminated widely to all health care providers. In short, the ideal M&M
would identify that medicine is difficult, acknowledge our accountability in
providing quality care, but recognize that errors also allow for further
learning and quality improvement.39
SPREADING 
AND 
SUSTAINING
CHANGE
Dissemination
As noted, the hard-earned lessons that can be derived from an error
reporting and analysis must subsequently be disseminated to achieve full
value from these lessons. For external reporting systems, one potential
model is again from the Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) run by
NASA. From NASA, monthly safety newsletters are issued in which case
reports are discussed and a monthly update on ASRS alerts is reported.
Also, alert bulletins are generated as needed to highlight subjects that have
arisen through incident report analysis regarding conditions or situations
that may compromise safety.23
Current medical external error reporting systems attempt to disseminate
information in a similar fashion. The PSRS for the Veterans Administration
distributes quarterly safety newsletters to disseminate the lessons learned
from its incident evaluations. The Joint Commission (TJC) Sentinel Event
System issues Sentinel Event Alerts to highlight potential system issues
identified through its error reporting database and propose potential
improvement measures. As of 2013, 50 Sentinel Event alerts have been
generated through this system and are sent to their member organizations.
These reports are also available for review (www.jointcomission.org). The
Institute for Safe Medication Practices generates a biweekly e-mail
newsletter called Medication Safety Alert Acute Care, which is sent to
subscribers at hospitals, pharmacies, pharmaceutical companies, and the
FDA to report up-to-date information on medication and device errors as
well as adverse drug reactions.
Dissemination of knowledge learned from internal, voluntary error
reporting is just as vital to ensure a culture of safety. As noted, one deterrent
to voluntary error reporting is lack of feedback creating a perception that
error reporting is not worthwhile.27 At a minimum, successful error
reporting systems have timely feedback to the reporters to both spur quality
improvement as well as encourage future reporting.30 Hospital-wide
newsletters and e-mail may represent an efficient way to disseminate
lessons learned from adverse events; however, these media may have lower
impact if lost in the flurry of electronic messages generated on a daily basis
in a typical hospital setting. One program that has shown promise is the use
of executive walk rounds in which senior executives, such as the hospital
president or chief nursing officer, held weekly rounds in different areas of
the hospital with senior patient safety officers.44 At each area, the group
holds with the present physicians, nurses, and staff informal rounds to
obtain information about potential safety issues, such as near misses or
system vulnerabilities. Also, the staff is encouraged to discuss possible
solutions or describe their own practices to improve patient safety. The goal
of this program was to further inculcate a culture of safety by both
obtaining information about safety issues as well as reinforcing the
importance of safety in the delivery of health care. At least one study
suggests that implementation of these rounds can lead to improvements in
the safety climate of an institution, with nurses reporting a stronger
perception that patient safety is constantly reinforced and that senior
leadership is appropriately prioritizing patient safety.45
Implementation
The ultimate goal of a safety culture is the implementation of significant
changes and quality improvement using the lessons learned from adverse
events and errors. As will be discussed in the next chapter, event analysis
must be performed on adverse events with an emphasis on determining
systems improvements that can strengthen patient safety. Root cause
analysis, with a focus on identifying the myriad of contributing underlying
causes that lead to adverse events, can allow for the identification and
correction of suboptimal processes. Through this process, organizations can
encourage continuous improvement in providing the safest, most efficient,
and most effective delivery of health care to its patients.
However, organizations must be willing and eager to embrace change to
allow process improvements to be sustained. In a series of case reports
describing health care organizations implementing wide-scale safety
improvements,46 the common theme for all of these organizations was the
need to change the existing culture by raising expectations, rewarding
safety improvements, and supporting a learning culture in which reforms
are based on data derived from internal and external data. Closing the
feedback loop by implementing improvements derived from error reporting
and event analysis sends a clear signal to all stakeholders that error
reporting is worthwhile and can lead to significant change. Strong follow-
up from senior leadership to ensure that action plans generated by root
cause analysis are implemented not only ensures accountability but also
reinforces to all members of the organization leadership's emphasis on a
culture of safety.47
In summary, sustaining change can only occur if there is a system-wide
commitment to evolve. The organization must be ready to embrace change
and recognize that the present state is not satisfactory. There must be strong
leadership to clearly and consistently communicate the importance of
patient safety and implement process improvements. Feedback must be
timely and continuous, encouraging the use of techniques that reduce errors
and addressing suboptimal system processes as they are identified. Finally,
the commitment to change cannot waver as improvements are made;
otherwise, the desired permanent change to culture may not occur.45,48,49
KEY POINTS
Safety culture surveys are necessary to obtain baseline data on the
current culture environment prior to any interventions used to
improve patient outcomes.
Establishing a Just Culture requires balancing error reporting,
avoiding 
blame, 
analyzing 
systems, 
holding 
personal
accountability, and having the highest degree of professionalism
to prevent errors and near misses.
Error reporting systems work best in a nonpunitive environment,
when reporting is simple and easy to perform, and when clear
feedback is provided to reporters.
Adverse events and error reporting systems require timely, expert
analysis of events with appropriate focus on root causes and
potential system improvements.
Morbidity and mortality conference is a powerful yet still
underutilized opportunity to promote accountability and quality
improvement.
Hard-earned lessons derived from adverse events and error
reporting must be disseminated widely to obtain full value from
these lessons.

13 Event Analysis
Rosalyn Corcoran and Katherine E. Henderson
CLINICAL VIGNETTE
Ms. W is a 67-year-old woman with lung cancer admitted to the hospital for
shortness of breath. During the initial intake, she was noted to have a
history of falls at home. Standard fall precaution orders were placed. At
9:40 pm, the patient used the call system to request someone assist her to the
bathroom. The unit secretary indicted that someone would be in shortly. At
9:43 pm, the patient's nurse entered the room and found the patient on the
floor. The patient had a small laceration to the right elbow and complained
of right hip pain. A femur x-ray demonstrated an acute right femoral neck
fracture. The patient's roommate witnessed the patient fall. According to the
patient's roommate, the patient was trying to walk to the bathroom even
though there was a bedside commode present.
Who should be notified about this event?
What are the next steps that should be taken?
How would this event be classified?
INTRODUCTION
Medical errors are devastating events for both patients and caregivers.
Having a well-thought-out plan for how you and your institution will
respond when an error occurs before it actually happens will ensure a more
effective response. In this chapter, we cover the basics of event analysis
including initial response to an error, classification of events, debriefing,
root cause analysis, and crisis management.
WHAT TO DO IF AN ERROR
OCCURS
Immediate Actions
The error should be reported immediately to the patient's attending
physician if he/she is not already aware of the situation. Risk
management should also be made aware of the error either by entering
the details into the institution's event reporting system or, especially if
the event has resulted in harm to the patient, by calling risk
management directly.
The facts as known should be disclosed to the patient. The attending of
record should perform the disclosure to the patient. Please refer to
Chapter 14 for a more detailed explanation of disclosure.
Any devices involved in the event (e.g., intravenous [IV] pump and
tubing, cardiac monitor, etc.) should be taken out of service
immediately and sequestered for evaluation.
In accordance with the Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990
(SMDA) (Public Law 101–629),1 all medical devices that may
have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury must be
reported to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and/or to
the manufacturers within 10 working days.
The FDA may impose civil penalties for failure to comply with
this reporting requirement.
To further the safety evaluation process, many hospitals
encourage the reporting of all failed medical devices, regardless
of level of harm.
Reportable events of failed medical devices may include the
following:
Failure of a diagnostic device when there is information to
reasonably suggest a probability that misdiagnosis or lack of
diagnosis has or could have caused or contributed to a death
and serious injury.
Event due to user error or failure to service or maintain the
device.
Failure of a surgically implanted device.
Malfunction of a device that supports or sustains life.
Device malfunction or failure that necessitates medical or
surgical intervention to preclude permanent impairment of a
body function or permanent damage to a body structure.
Device causes permanent impairment of a body function or
damage to a body structure.
Risk management should perform an evaluation for
immediate jeopardy. Immediate jeopardy is a situation in
which the hospital's noncompliance with one or more
requirements of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid
Services (CMS) Conditions of Participation (CoP) has
caused, or is likely to cause, serious injury, harm,
impairment, or death to a patient (see Table 13-1).2

(From: CMS State Operations Manual, Appendix Q – Guidelines for Determining Immediate
Jeopardy, 
http://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-
Guidance/Guidance/Manuals/downloads/som107ap_q_immedjeopardy.pdf)
If an immediate jeopardy situation exists, corrective measures must be
taken to abate the immediate jeopardy situation and correct deficient
practices. If a hospital receives an immediate jeopardy citation, that hospital
and any other hospital in its system must undergo a complete inspection
within 23 days or risk losing their Medicare and Medicaid funding. Of note,
surveyors may place a hospital in immediate jeopardy even if only 1 patient
has been harmed or is at risk of harm. Consequences of noncompliance with
the CMS CoP can include the following:
Termination from both the Medicare and State Medicaid program
Loss of deemed status from its accrediting body—resulting in
jurisdiction shift to the state agency
Loss of public goodwill and trust
Loss of third-party payor contracts if linked to continued Medicare
participation
Event Investigation
After an error occurs, it is important to establish the facts surrounding
the event. This is best done with a debriefing. A debriefing is a meeting
of all of those directly involved in the care of the patient. It is best
done within the first 48–72 hours following the event, before
memories begin to fade. The debriefing meeting is a fact-finding
mission with the purpose of understanding and identifying
vulnerabilities in the care delivery system (the “holes in the Swiss
cheese”), which allowed harm to reach the patient. A debriefing is
specifically not an opportunity to point fingers or lay blame. When
conducting a debriefing, it is important that leadership does not assume
going into the meeting that they already know what happened during
the event. Very often, initial assumptions prove to be either incorrect or
incomplete. The Joint Commission has published a collection of 12
best practices for debriefings (Of note, these practices can be applied
to recurring events such as postprocedure debriefings or to critical
incidents such as medical errors)3:
Debriefings must be diagnostic: The team should understand that
the debriefing is intended to be a learning opportunity aimed at
better understanding the inherent weaknesses in the system in
which they work.
The debrief environment should be a supportive learning
environment where all team members feel comfortable
contributing to the conversation and sharing observations and
opinions. Leadership should appreciate the benefits of debriefing
and make time for team members to participate.
Teamwork 
behaviors 
such 
as 
coordination, 
effective
communication, shared situation assessment, and leadership
should be addressed during the debriefing.
Debrief leaders/facilitators should be educated in the art and
science of leading a debriefing and understand their role and
responsibilities as facilitators.
It is vitally important that team members feel comfortable during
the debriefing. The atmosphere should be collegial and
nonthreatening. All participants should be given an equal role and
have an equal voice regardless of their roles on the patient care
team (i.e., attending physicians, residents, nurses, and students
should all have an equal voice). Ideally, team members should be
comfortably seated at eye level with each other in a quiet space
where they can easily hear one another.
Focus on critical performance issues. There is typically a limited
amount of time available to accomplish the debriefing, so it is
important that the team focus on bringing out and highlighting all
of the elements that contributed to the event.
Describe specific teamwork interactions and processes that were
key elements of the team's performance including issues of
leadership, delegation, communication, and problem assessment.
Support feedback with objective performance indicators.
Provide outcome feedback later and less frequently than process
feedback, as even with successful outcomes an opportunity may
exist to improve processes.
Provide individual and team-oriented feedback but know when
each is most appropriate.
Shorten the delay between task performance and feedback as
much as possible.
Record conclusions made and goals set during the debriefing to
facilitate feedback during future debriefings and to track progress
over time.
Debriefings should be used with near misses as well as actual events,
since the same circumstances surrounding one patient's near miss may lead
to harm for the next patient.
CLASSIFICATION OF EVENTS
The Institute of Medicine (IOM) report “To Err is Human” defines medical
errors as “the failure of a planned action to be completed as intended or the
use of a wrong plan to achieve an aim.”4 In order to respond to errors and
work to prevent them, we must first study them and understand why they
happened. Several classification systems exist to aid in the study of medical
errors.
The Joint Commission's sentinel events
The Joint Commission defines a sentinel event as “an unexpected
occurrence involving death or serious physical or psychological
injury, or the risk thereof.”5 These events (see Table 13-2) require
immediate investigation and response. Of note, the Joint
Commission recognizes that not all sentinel events occur due to
an error and not all errors result in a sentinel event.
TABLE 13-2 The Joint Commission List of Reviewable Sentinel
Events
(Adapted from: The Joint Commission Sentinel Event Policy and Procedures in the
Comprehensive 
Accreditation 
Manual 
for 
Hospitals,
http://www.jointcommission.org/assets/1/6/CAMH_2012_Update2_24_SE.pdf)
Response to a reviewable event:
Prepare a root cause analysis (see Root Cause Analysis
section below) and action plan within 45 calendar days of
the event or of becoming aware of the event.
Submit the root cause analysis and action plan to the Joint
Commission with 45 calendar days of the known occurrence
of the event. The Joint Commission will then determine if
the root cause analysis and action plan are acceptable.
World Health Organization (WHO) taxonomy
The WHO has published a set of standardized concepts for
organizations worldwide to use when reporting and classifying
incidents (see Table 13-3). The product, called the International
Classification for Patient Safety, is a conceptual framework designed
to standardize definitions and terms to facilitate the trending,
monitoring, and analysis of events to improve overall patient safety.6
TABLE 13-3 WHO Conceptual Framework for the International
Classification 
for 
Patient 
Safety
(Adapted from: More than words: Conceptual framework for the international classification
for patient safety, version 1.1. WHO Technical Report, January 2009.)
Eindhoven Classification Model
The Eindhoven model7 was originally designed for the chemical
processing industry but has since been adapted for health care. The
model classifies factors contributing to errors into three different types:
technical (e.g., problems with equipment design/installation, software,
forms, etc.), organizational (e.g., organizational culture, policies, or
priorities), and human. The model uses a predefined order of
operations—which specifies that human error be considered last—to
counteract traditional bias toward stopping event analysis at the
employee level without considering technical or organizational
contributions to the system failure.
Harm or severity grading
Some scales categorize errors based on the severity of the outcome.
National Coordinating Council for Medication Errors
Reporting and Prevention (NCC MERP) Index
Although the NCC MERP initially developed their categorization
process for medication errors, the index has been widely adopted
across health care as a tool to categorize all medical errors. This
Index uses an A to I rating scale that spans unsafe conditions
without harm to events that result in death (see Table 13-4).8,9
TABLE 13-4 Modified NCC MERP Index for Reporting Medical Errors or
Adverse 
Events
(Adapted from: Griffin FA, Resar RK. IHI Global Trigger Tool for Measuring Adverse Events. 2nd
ed. IHI Innovation Series White Paper. Cambridge, MA: Institute for Healthcare Improvement; 2009,
Available on www.IHI.org)
ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
As the IOM report “To Err is Human” highlighted in 1999, most medical
errors are made by bright, well-intentioned people coming to work each day
doing the best they can in a very complex environment that, in many ways,
sets them up to fail. In many cases, one could swap out all of the people
involved in a medical error—the physicians, staff, and even the patients
themselves—and, if the same circumstances aligned again, the same results
would be achieved. To truly prevent medical errors, we must focus on
making changes to the environment in which they occur.
The Joint Commission defines a root cause analysis (RCA) as “a
process for identifying the factors that underlie variation in performance,
including the occurrence or possible occurrence of a sentinel event.” The
focus of a root cause analysis should be on systems and processes rather
than on individual performance, and the product of this analysis is an action
plan that identifies strategies to reduce the risk of similar events occurring
in the future. Action plans should address responsibility for implementation
and oversight, pilot testing (when appropriate), timelines, and measures of
effectiveness of the plan. Events that meet criteria for a sentinel event (see
Table 13-2) require a root cause analysis and action plan to be submitted to
the Joint Commission within 45 days. The Joint Commission will then
review the root cause analysis to decide if it is acceptable, thorough, and
credible based on the criteria outlined below5:
An acceptable root cause analysis has the following characteristics:
The analysis focuses primarily on systems and processes, not on
individual performance.
The analysis progresses from special causes in clinical processes
to common causes in organizational processes.
The analysis repeatedly digs deeper by repeatedly asking “Why?”
The analysis identifies changes that could be made in systems and
processes (either through redesign or by development of new
systems or processes) that would reduce the risk of such events
occurring in the future.
The analysis is thorough and credible.
A thorough root cause analysis must include the following:
A determination of the human and other factors most directly
associated with the sentinel event and the process(es) and systems
related to its occurrence
An analysis of the underlying systems and processes through a
series of “why?” questions to determine where redesign might
reduce risk
An inquiry into all areas appropriate to the specific type of event
(e.g., behavioral assessment, patient identification process, care
planning 
process, 
continuum 
of 
care, 
staffing 
levels,
orientation/training, 
competency 
assessment/credentialing,
supervision, 
communication 
between 
staff 
and 
with
patient/family, 
availability 
of 
information, 
adequacy 
of
technologic 
support, 
equipment 
maintenance/management,
physical environment, security systems/processes, medication
management)
An identification of risk points and their potential contributions to
this type of event
A determination of potential improvement in processes or systems
that would tend to decrease the likelihood of such events in the
future, or a determination, after analysis, that no such
improvement opportunities exist
A credible root cause analysis must do the following:
Include participation by the leadership of the hospital and by
individuals most closely involved in the processes and systems
under review.
Be internally consistent (not contradict itself or leave obvious
questions unanswered).
Provide an explanation for all findings of “not applicable” or “no
problem.”
Include consideration of any relevant literature.
In more recent years, the study of human factors engineering has been
integrated into the RCA process. The Human Factors and Ergonomics
Society defines human factors as “the application of what we know about
people, their abilities, characteristics, and limitations to the design of
equipment they use, environments in which they function and jobs they
perform.”10 Addressing factors that affect performance (e.g., fatigue, stress,
task interruptions/distractions, familiarity with task, etc.) during the RCA
process will help to ensure that the team has truly highlighted the system
and process issues that led to the error. Incorporating human factors
engineering design strategies such as forcing functions, checklists, and
redundant processes, into the resulting action plan will lead to designing
systems that are more resilient to unanticipated events. (See Chapter 16,
Human Factors, for a more detailed description of human factors
engineering in health care.)
CRISIS MANAGEMENT
As Benjamin Franklin once said, “By failing to prepare, you are preparing
to fail.” All health care organizations will, at some point, experience a
crisis, whether that be a natural disaster, a mass casualty event, or a medical
error that allows harm to come to a patient. At such times, the organization
will be judged as much by its response to the crisis as it is to the actual
event itself. Organizations need to be prepared for, rather than just react to,
unexpected crises. Most organizations have a management plan to deal with
the unexpected facility or weather crisis, but few have adapted this process
to respond to a patient safety event. The Institute for Healthcare
Improvement (IHI) has developed a white paper that contains tools to assist
organizations to manage crises and has identified some key elements of
effective clinical crisis management (see Table 13-5).11,12 The IHI white
paper highlights the importance of establishing a plan and then
implementing the plan when a serious event occurs stating, “The risks of
not responding to a serious event in a timely and effective manner include,
but are not limited to, loss of trust among patients, sending of mixed
messages to employees regarding the organization's commitment to safety
and quality, absence of healing, absence of learning and improvement,
increased likelihood of regulatory action or lawsuits, and media that are all
too willing to play ‘gotcha’ with an organization that is not prepared to
publicly address a serious clinical event.”12

Elements 
of 
Clinical 
Crisis 
Management
(Adapted from: Conway JB, Sadler BL, Stewart K. Planning for a clinical crisis. Healthc Exec.
2010;25(6):78–81.)
Based on feedback from readers, the IHI white paper was revised in
2011 to contain a more in-depth focus on four key areas: the apology,
reimbursement and compensation, second victims, and creating a “burning
platform” for change.13 The updated version is an excellent reference for
health care systems to create a proactive blueprint for crisis management.
ROLE OF RISK MANAGEMENT
Historically, the risk manager's role was to act as a resource to staff as well
as to protect the organization after something bad had already happened.
Partnering with the quality staff was not consistent. Many times the
reporting structures were not aligned, resulting in silos of information,
ineffective communication, overlapping efforts, and ineffective process
improvement efforts. Traditional functions of risk management centered
around protecting the organization's financial assets and reputation (e.g.,
loss prevention, claims management, policy and contract review, worker's
compensation, etc.). Quality managers, on the other hand, typically focused
on improving patient care and outcomes while not necessarily worrying
about financial loss or litigation.14
Over the last decade, the roles of risk management and quality
improvement have converged to develop a partnership with the goal of
advancing patient safety in a coordinated manner. Some key changes that
have promoted this new collaboration include15:
Establishment of new organizational models in which risk
management, quality improvement, and patient safety functions are all
embedded within one department
Development of new terminology to encompass traditional roles (e.g.,
“quality risk management” and “clinical effectiveness”)
Change in culture from being reactive to proactive in response to
patient safety events
Joint investigation and analysis of patient safety events
Need to respond to continually expanding and evolving requirements
from external regulatory agencies
Regardless of how the changes are implemented, open communication
between risk managers and quality managers is becoming critical. In the
current era of patient safety, these roles have begun to overlap. In order to
further advance patient safety, risk managers and quality managers must
communicate effectively and align their activities.
KEY POINTS
All medical errors and near misses should be reported into the
institution's safety event reporting system.
Any devices involved in the event should be taken out of service
immediately and sequestered for evaluation.

Debriefings of events should be done as close in time to the event
as possible and with the involvement of all those directly
involved in the patient's care.
Root cause analysis should be performed to identify system and
process issues, which contributed to the event.
All health care organizations should have a proactive plan in
place to respond to patient safety events.

and Medical Errors: Supporting
the Patient, the Family, and the
Provider

CLINICAL VIGNETTE
A 79-year-old man was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with
multifocal pneumonia and sepsis. He had been emergently intubated for
respiratory failure and placed on mechanical ventilation. The patient had
only one peripheral venous catheter in the right hand through which he was
receiving intravenous fluids and antibiotics. In the face of refractory
hypotension, it was determined that central venous access was needed to
administer vasopressors. After more than five failed attempts, a resident
physician was finally successful in inserting a right-sided subclavian central
venous catheter and a norepinephrine infusion was subsequently started.
Thirty minutes later, the patient became acutely hypoxemic and tachycardic.
The ventilator registered an increase in airway pressures and a nurse noticed
diminished breath sounds on the right side with tracheal deviation to the
left. Needle decompression was performed with some improvement in vital
signs. A portable chest film confirmed a large right-sided pneumothorax.
INTRODUCTION
Unanticipated adverse events and harmful medical errors are unfortunate
yet common occurrences in health care. An adverse event is defined as
harm caused by medical care (e.g., medication-related anaphylaxis,
contrast-induced nephropathy, pneumothorax due to central venous catheter
insertion) rather than an underlying disease process. While the outcome is
undesirable, an adverse event does not imply error, negligence, or poor care.
A medical error has occurred when a planned action is not completed as
intended or an incorrect action fails to achieve a desired effect (e.g.,
ordering a medication to which a patient has a documented drug allergy,
administering intravenous contrast to a patient in acute renal failure,
performing orthopedic surgery on the wrong extremity). Medical errors are
generally unintentional but often arise in the setting of incorrect diagnoses,
complex processes, inadequately designed systems, insufficient training or
clinical experience, and breakdowns in team communication.
The impact of adverse events and medical errors on our patients and
their families ranges from temporary harm to death, and costs can be
financial, emotional, and physical. In the US, medical errors alone are
responsible for anywhere from 44,000 to 98,000 preventable hospital deaths
annually.1 Adverse events and medical errors are common, and there is a
high likelihood that every health care provider will be involved in one or
more throughout the course of their clinical career.
Disclosing errors to patients and families and coping with the aftermath
of errors personally and professionally are two of the more difficult aspects
of being a health care provider. This chapter will explore a rationale for
disclosure in health care and identify best practices each health care
provider should take in the aftermath of an adverse event or medical error.
Effective strategies to facilitate clear and accurate communication with
patients and their families will be emphasized. In addition, the toll that
adverse events and medical errors take on the health care provider as a
“second victim” will be discussed. Recommendations for how to cope in
these stressful professional circumstances, including a discussion of
potentially helpful informal and formal support services and strategies, are
outlined. Planning a structured approach when disclosing errors and a
strategy to seek support ahead of time can help a health care provider better
handle the stress associated with such events, enabling him or her to focus
on fully supporting a patient recovering after a devastating adverse event or
medical error.
THE 
RATIONALE 
FOR
DISCLOSURE
It is a fundamental ethical requirement that a physician should at all times deal honestly and
openly with patients. Patients have a right to know their past and present medical status and to
be free of any mistaken beliefs concerning their conditions. Situations occasionally occur in
which a patient suffers significant medical complications that may have resulted from the
physician's mistake or judgment. In these situations, the physician is ethically required to
inform the patient of all the facts necessary to ensure understanding of what has occurred.
Only through full disclosure is a patient able to make informed decisions regarding future
medical care.
Code of Medical Ethics, American Medical Association2
While the concept of disclosing adverse events and medical errors to
patients is not a new one, it has gained increasing attention and acceptance
in health care since 2000 with the publication of the Institute of Medicine's
landmark report,1 “To Err is Human: Building a Safer Health System,” and
the adoption of new patient safety and disclosure standards by the Joint
Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) a year
later. At the most basic level, disclosure is rooted in ethical responsibilities
to patients shared by all health care providers. Respect for patient autonomy
and the preservation of informed consent are fundamental reasons why
disclosure of unanticipated outcomes is necessary. Professional and moral
obligations for health care providers to deal openly and honestly with
patients also favor truthful communication. Despite this, many health care
providers are reluctant to disclose adverse events and medical errors.
A common barrier to disclosure is the fear of litigation. Yet, the
experiences of several prominent institutions with programs promoting
open disclosure in concert with early resolution of malpractice claims paint
a different picture. Disclosure, honesty, and transparency have been
associated with reductions in liability payments, legal expenses, and in
some cases even the number of claims and lawsuits filed.3–5 Such proactive
strategies are more likely to promote fair and just compensation of patients
after an adverse event or medical error, defend reasonable medical care, and
limit costly punitive claims. In fact, poor physician–patient communication
lies at the heart of many malpractice claims.6 A family's inability to obtain
information, perceptions that some physicians had been misleading or
dishonest, and the sense that other physicians would neither listen to nor
answer their questions have all been described as key motivators in the
decision to file suit.7 Viewed in this light, disclosure is a unique opportunity
to provide patients and their families with much needed information and
formal acknowledgment of what they are going through and may also serve
to diffuse tensions between patients, family members, and health care
providers.
Litigation aside, fears of disciplinary action and the loss of reputation
among patients and peers alike make disclosure feared by many health care
providers. Morbidity and mortality conferences and peer review committees
have long offered opportunities for physicians to review adverse outcomes,
though they have historically been associated on some level with shame and
blame. The paradigm of a “just culture” where errors can be discussed
openly and nonjudgmentally without censure has been a mainstay in other
high-reliability industries and is becoming increasingly accepted as a
necessary foundation for modern health care. Done well, disclosure brings a
new level of transparency and accountability to health care that patients
appreciate and hospitals value as a part of ongoing quality improvement. In
addition, while patients hope for ideal health care interactions, research has
shown that most understand that medical errors sometimes occur.8,9 When
asked, patients actually maintain that disclosure enhances trust in their
physicians' honesty and reassures them that they are seeing the whole
picture of their care.
Significant variation exists among physicians in what information they
choose to reveal to their patients after an error, underscoring a need for a
standard approach to disclosure, not only to satisfy patient expectations but
to uphold physician accountability.10 Formal disclosure education with
supervised practice is particularly beneficial to trainees, including resident
physicians and medical students, increasing their comfort with and
willingness to disclose errors in the future.11,12
Health care providers also worry that disclosure might cause additional
and unnecessary distress to the patient. While powerful emotions of
sadness, anxiety, and even anger are common after an error, the way in
which a disclosure is made has a direct bearing on how patients react.
Sometimes, the desire to portray an error in the best possible light by the
physician not only hinders the free flow of information but creates the guise
of evasiveness, increasing patient distrust of their providers.8 Patients may
be less likely to be upset if they perceive that an error has been disclosed
honestly and compassionately and a sincere apology has been made.8
In summary, disclosure is a crucial part of the frank discourse between
patients and their health care providers after an adverse event or medical
error. It provides formal acknowledgement of the patient's suffering and
validation of their emotional experience. It also offers a unique starting
point from which health care providers can begin to learn from their errors,
identify ways to prevent errors from occurring again, and find much needed
professional support to move forward.
THE PROCESS OF DISCLOSURE
General Principles
Disclosure is appropriate when an adverse event or medical error has
resulted in temporary or permanent harm, necessitated patient transfer to an
ICU, or required additional surgery or other medical intervention. A simpler
albeit more subjective gauge of appropriateness might be whether you
would want to know about a specific adverse event or medical error if it
happened to you or a member of your family. The fundamental principle
guiding disclosure should be the patient's right to know about significant
events that may impact their health and well-being. Disclosure of
nonsignificant events that do not harm a patient should be guided by the
provider's clinical judgment. Disclosure is best viewed as a proportional
responsibility. The greater the harm or risk of harm caused by an event, the
greater the duty to disclose the event to the patient.
Patients who have suffered an adverse event or medical error
consistently seek the following things8:
An explicit acknowledgment that an error has occurred
An explanation of what went wrong and why
An assessment of the clinical impact on their health
An apology for what they are going through
A description of how the error will be prevented in the future
Patients expect that their health care providers will be well prepared to
discuss an adverse event or medical error, with empathy and caring. They
seek shared dialogue, support, and follow-up as they recover from the event
and as more information comes to light. They also want to know that
providers have learned from the event and that processes have been
improved. Yet, many disclosures fail to meet these fundamental needs and
expectations.13,14
Preparing for Disclosure
Preparation before a disclosure ensures that an accurate and consistent
message is communicated. When multiple providers are involved, every
effort should be made to promote collaboration in shaping the disclosure
conversation prior to any discussion with the patient or family. Residents
and fellows should work in concert with their attending physician.
Consensus should be reached beforehand on what basic information will be
disclosed. Each provider should only disclose errors for which they bear
personal responsibility. Physicians should not discuss errors made by other
health care providers without involving those individuals in the
conversation. It is helpful to anticipate questions the patient or family might
ask and agree upon a set of uniform responses among providers. Simulating
and practicing the disclosure conversation in a safe environment can build
confidence and identify areas for improvement. Many institutions have
developed disclosure coaching programs to aid with this process. Early
consultation and inclusion of risk management and patient safety specialists
can provide invaluable guidance and support in refining the disclosure
conversation and understanding the true malpractice risk of the event or
error.15
Whenever appropriate and possible, it may be helpful to bring the
patient care team involved together (e.g., physicians, nurses, pharmacists,
technicians, social workers, case managers) to verify the facts of the event
and ensure an accurate and consistent message across the care team and
multiple clinical services. Invaluable insight into the state of mind of the
patient and family as well as their level of comprehension and medical
literacy can be gained from the different perspectives of each member of the
team. Cultural and language barriers can also be identified and addressed to
best facilitate the conversation.
Determining which health care providers should participate in the actual
disclosure conversation must take into account the provider's level of
involvement in the event, their ability to provide a positive contribution to
the discussion, and their emotional state. It is important to identify a
provider who will lead the conversation, preferably someone with an
established and trusting relationship with the patient. While this is usually
an attending physician, nurses and other providers may also serve in this
capacity depending on the nature of the event. When planning the
disclosure conversation, one should recognize that a patient may benefit
from the support of family and/or friends during the conversation and
coordinate their presence accordingly. The involvement of a chaplain, social
worker, patient advocate, or an interpreter, if a language barrier exists, may
likewise be appropriate in many circumstances.
Communicating Error
Timely, honest, and sustained communication is essential after an adverse
event or medical error. Ideally, this is a series of conversations. The first
conversation should take place as soon as the patient is stable enough to
understand the information presented and adequate preparation for the
conversation has taken place. In some instances, an initial conversation may
occur with an authorized member of the patient's family if the patient is
unable to participate. Do not delay the first conversation pending a full
analysis of the event.
In crafting the first conversation, it is crucial to remember that
disclosure is not about claiming liability, making excuses, or criticizing the
care of other health care providers. It is a formal encounter that focuses on
the unambiguous exchange of clinical information, active listening and
acknowledgment of patient and family questions and concerns, and
identification of constructive solutions to address the patient's current
situation and prevent future events, assuring them that you are always
available to discuss this further and identifying who will be the primary
contact for this is an important parting message. A structured approach to
disclosure increases the likelihood that the patient's needs are adequately
met. We have found the following guidelines to be helpful in improving the
quality and success of a disclosure conversation (Table 14-1).
TABLE 14-1 Guidelines for Conducting a Successful Disclosure
Throughout the disclosure conversation, providers should be seated at
eye level with the patient. They should speak slowly and clearly. Ample
opportunity for questions should be permitted. It is reasonable to ask if a
patient's or family's needs are being met, both in terms of the information
presented and the medical care provided. They should also be reassured and
reminded that efforts to correct the event or error are underway and that
they will be updated in a timely fashion through later conversations.
Documenting Error
The patient's medical record should contain accurate documentation of the
event, including date, time, and place. The patient's medical condition
immediately before and after the event followed by what medical
interventions 
(e.g., 
diagnostic 
studies, 
medications, 
procedures,
consultations, if appropriate) were initiated should be clearly described
along with the patient's response to these interventions. Future treatment
plans should be outlined.
Disclosure and other important medical care conversations with patients
and their family should always be documented in the medical record,
including time, date, and place of the discussion. The names and
relationships of those present at the discussion, what was discussed, and
patient/family responses should be described in detail. In this way, all
subsequent members of the health care team will know what the patient and
family were told, cementing transparency among the team with the patient.
Providing Support for Patients After an
Error
Preserving an open line of communication between patients, families, and
health care providers is critical after a disclosure has taken place. It is
common for patients to have other questions after the initial conversation,
and these should be addressed in an honest and timely manner. Whereas
some patients are content with knowing that an adverse event or medical
error has occurred and that something is being done to address it, others
may want additional, more detailed information as it becomes available.
Additional emotional support and comfort can be found in chaplains,
mental health clinicians, therapists, social workers, patient advocates, and
other trained staff, and their involvement should be welcomed.
In many cases, it is reasonable and appropriate for a provider that has
been directly involved in an adverse event or medical error to remain
engaged in the clinical care of the victim. Doing so not only preserves the
continuity of care but strengthens the therapeutic bond between providers
and patients. Yet, there will also be times when a transition of care is
necessary to restore trust and confidence in that bond. In conclusion,
disclosing an error requires that physicians carefully plan how best to
support the patient and families ahead of time, disclose the error openly and
honestly, and listen and respond to the immediate and ongoing needs of the
patient and family members.
CARING 
FOR 
THE 
SECOND
VICTIM
Almost every physician and nurse has their story, their case, and their night. They remember
the details as if it were yesterday, even if it was 10 or 20 years ago. They tell their stories with
an intensity of emotion that brings tears to the eyes of both, the storyteller and the listener.
Many have never shared their stories with anyone; some, with only a spouse or close friend.
These stories usually end with expressions of shame, isolation, and lack of closure. The
counsel received at the time of the incident, if any, included: “Stuff happens,” “You can't dwell
on it,” “You'll just have to do it better the next time,” and “Go back to work”… Given that the
vast majority of errors are due to failures of bad systems and not bad people, providing
support to clinicians and other staff at the sharp end of medical care is simply the respectful
and compassionate thing to do.
James B. Conway, MD, Institute for Healthcare Improvement16
Traditionally, supporting the physical and emotional needs of patients and
their families has been the single focus after an adverse event or medical
error, without recognizing that health care providers can become “second
victims,” silent and forgotten.17 For many providers, a serious medical error
can rank among one of the worst experiences of their life, replete with
profound emotions of sadness, anger, embarrassment, and fear.18,19 Loss of
self-confidence, reduced job satisfaction, difficulty sleeping, and heightened
anxiety about committing future errors are common and can be
debilitating.20 Physicians are more likely to be distressed after serious
errors if they have had a negative disclosure experience, are worried that
they have a high risk of being sued, or feel unsupported after an error.
One of the greatest challenges faced by many physicians after an event
is learning to forgive themselves for making the error.8 No physician wants
their decisions or actions to be inadvertently associated with causing patient
harm. Guilt and self-blame can lead providers to isolate themselves,
experience job burnout and emotional exhaustion, and even quit the practice
of medicine altogether.21 In the most severe circumstances, there have been
reports of health care professionals taking their own lives in the aftermath
of a medical error.22
The natural history of recovery after an adverse event or medical error
by health care providers has been conceptualized based on qualitative
interviews with physicians, nurses, and other health care providers.23,24 In
the immediate aftermath of an event, the provider struggles first to
understand what has happened (chaos and accident response). They can be
distracted in self-reflection, even while continuing to care for the patient in
some cases. As the initial crisis stabilizes, the provider replays the event
over and over in their mind, asking “what if” questions (intrusive
reflections). This behavior cultivates a sense of inadequacy and self-
isolation. The provider often searches for support from a trusted colleague,
supervisor, friend, or family member (restoring personal integrity). They
worry about the future of their career, what their colleagues will think of
them, and whether they will ever be trusted to care for a patient again. As
the full impact of the event sets in, the provider faces an uncertain future in
which they might lose their job or medical license, or face litigation
(enduring the inquisition). They search for reassurance and guidance from a
trusted and “safe” figure (obtaining emotional first aid). Finally, the
provider drops out, survives, or thrives (moving on). In the first of these, the
provider finds a different job, works in a different location, or completely
leaves the profession behind. In the second, the provider continues to work
but is chronically haunted by the event. In the latter, the provider has turned
the negative experience of the event into something positive, perhaps
through practice changes at the personal, departmental, or even hospital
level.
As evidenced by prior research, it is natural that most providers will
feel high levels of stress and strong negative emotions after a serious
adverse event or medical error.25 Yet, choosing to seek support can be
difficult, especially for physicians experienced in dealing with difficult and
stressful situations common to the daily practice of medicine.20,26
Generally, the social stigma that comes with engaging mental health care or
institutional support systems (e.g., employee assistance programs) further
encourages suffering in a veil of silence and anonymity. Providers often
worry that the very act of seeking support will be documented in their
employment record and adversely impact the future of their career. In
addition, knowing what services are available, how to access them, and
whether they are confidential in the case of a malpractice lawsuit are all
formidable barriers. Finally, support, even when available, can be hard to
accept. Whether it comes from being regularly accustomed to the role of
caring for others or the fear of vulnerability, many physicians and other
health care providers have mastered the denial of their own medical and
emotional needs. Providers who isolate themselves or feel unsupported are
likely to have the greatest difficulty recovering after an error.20
Regardless of these barriers, physicians and other “second victims” are
seeking out and receiving support from a variety of informal and formal
support services after medical errors (Table 14-2). As our knowledge and
awareness of the second victim continues to mature, active strategies
favoring early recognition and rapid intervention will help us ensure that
these valuable members of our health care team are protected.
TABLE

Systems 
for 
Second 
Victims
Informal Support
For physicians, speaking with a trusted physician colleague about the event
is far more common practice than accessing traditional support mechanisms
such as employee assistance programs and mental health services.26 Shared
culture, clinical experiences, and burdens of responsibility can create an
honest and nonthreatening venue for discussing an event. This support is
enhanced even more if the supporting physician has had a similar personal
experience with an adverse event or medical error. Physicians may also
seek support from a physician leader, such as a departmental chairperson. A
similar reliance on trusted colleagues and managers for informal support is
seen among nurses and other health care providers alike.
Providers often share their experiences with their spouses or partners.25
The unconditional acceptance underpinning this type of relationship, or that
of a close friend, allows for open sharing and emotional vulnerability.
Formal Mental Health Support
Sometimes, informal discussion with trusted colleagues, spouses, partners,
and close friends is not enough. Patient safety and risk management offices,
where most of these events are initially reported, can be an invaluable
source of support. Physicians and other health care providers who
experience sleeplessness, depression, or anxiety after errors may benefit
from meeting with trained mental health professionals or counselors.
Employee assistance programs provide a wide range of services covering
alcohol and substance abuse, addiction, conflicts in the workplace, stress
management, and issues relating to marriage, parenthood, aging, and
personal finances. Personnel staffing these comprehensive programs draw
from backgrounds in clinical psychology, counseling, and social work.
Though not geared specifically toward second victims of errors, these
programs can provide much needed professional counseling and therapy,
particularly after events associated with significant emotional distress and
trauma. Consultation with a psychiatrist may be warranted in severe
instances to consider medical and other specialized therapies. Comfort may
also come from seeking the counsel of a spiritual or religious counselor,
such as chaplain.
Peer Support Systems by Other Health
Providers
A new formal support resource, a peer support system dedicated to caring
for second victims, has come of age over the past decade in many hospitals
across the US.27,28 Drawing upon successful models originally designed to
help first responders from law enforcement and emergency services cope
with a traumatic event, peer support systems are different from traditional
employee assistance and mental health programs in that they utilize clinical
care providers to provide peer support, instead of mental health
professionals. Peer supporters are respected providers within the institution,
including physicians, who have been trained to identify second victims and
those at risk of becoming one after an adverse event or medical error.
Having other providers as peer supporters ensures that common emotional
experiences felt after errors can truly be normalized and validated. Utilizing
other physicians can also help to shift the emphasis from individual “shame
and blame” to that of a “just culture,” more effectively recognizing that
entire systems and processes contribute to medical errors. Peer support also
seeks to combat the isolation that second victims may feel through early,
active, and ongoing engagement.
The approach of peer support is different from traditional therapy. Peer
supporters are trained to listen and empathize, providing immediate
emotional “first aid.” Some peer supporters volunteer because they, too,
were previously involved with an error and know how stressful the
experience can be. Second victims may be referred for peer support through
adverse event reporting, referral from patient safety or risk management, or
self-referral.
Although medical errors are common within the entirety of the health
care system, individual health care providers are unlikely to have an
extensive experience with errors; a health care provider who has been
involved with a medical error is often in a place of confusion and,
potentially, chaos. Having an experienced guide describe what will happen
in the aftermath of an error, how disclosure works, and how hospital
practices related to errors operate can set accurate expectations for what to
anticipate next. To maintain confidentiality, peer supporters generally listen,
but do not take notes. For a peer support system to be successful, it must:
Create a safe environment.
Be easily and reliably accessible immediately after the event.
Maintain the confidentiality of the second victim.
Convey empathy and reassurance in a nonjudgmental manner.
Counteract the natural tendency toward isolation.
Provide guidance and ongoing support, if desired, during the ensuing
analysis of the event.
Link second victims to additional professional resources when they are
needed (e.g., employee assistance programs and mental health
programs).
A key aim of peer support is to assure the provider that self-care is not
selfish and is, instead, a crucial step to recovery and getting back to caring
for others.
Peer supporters often educate providers about the processes by which
adverse events and medical errors are analyzed, explaining what will occur
in interviews with risk management, debriefings, root cause analyses,
quality improvement meetings, and morbidity and mortality conferences.
Sometimes, peer supporters or other colleagues offer to attend these
meetings with second victims. Second victims should be periodically
reassured that they are not alone and that they can depend on both their
informal support networks and the peer support system to help them get
through this challenging time.
Peer support is a cooperative effort. Every second victim is unique in
their experiences and needs. The degree and nature of engagement will vary
widely. Peer supporters should debrief regularly with other peer supporters
and patient safety leaders to share ideas, discuss strategies, and develop best
practices as to how to continue supporting our colleagues.
Finally, a tiered approach to second victim support balances the
preferences of health care providers to “be among their own” with the
responsibility to make the best use of limited mental health resources.28
While the rendering of emotional “first aid” at the time of the adverse event
or medical error by peer supporters is likely to meet the needs of most
second victims, some may require more guidance and nurturing over weeks
or months. When necessary, peer supporters also may escalate and expedite
referral to employee assistance programs and other specialized services
providing professional counseling, medical therapy, and longitudinal mental
health care, if warranted.
CLINICAL VIGNETTE REVISITED
The patient underwent right-sided tube thoracostomy with radiographic
improvement in the size of the pneumothorax. A brief meeting was
convened between the physicians, nurses, and respiratory therapist involved
in the patient's care. It was quickly determined that multiple attempts were
made by the resident physician before the subclavian vein was successfully
catheterized. Furthermore, a postinsertion chest film had not been ordered.
The physicians met with the patient's family. After making introductions,
the attending physician apologized and explained the nature of the adverse
event and what was being done to correct it. He concluded by stating that
they were looking further into the circumstances of the event and what
could be done in the future to prevent it from happening again.
The resident physician was understandably distraught and spoke
privately with both a colleague and his wife about how he was feeling after
disclosing the error. He was also actively engaged by a member of the peer
support team shortly after the incident, where they spoke at length about
what would happen next. The peer supporter checked in regularly with the
resident over the next 2 weeks. Eventually, they attended a patient safety
debriefing and root cause analysis of the event together. Based on a review
of central venous catheter insertion best practices, the resident physician
developed a protocol empowering nurses observing catheter insertions to
terminate the procedure if an operator exceeded more than three attempts
without success. He also developed a web-based module to educate other
trainees about safe and proper central venous catheterization in the months
to follow.
Meanwhile, the patient was extubated a week after the adverse event.
The thoracostomy tube was successfully removed and he was discharged
home without any further complications. The team kept the patient and his
family continuously apprised of the event analysis and the patient told them

that he was pleased that efforts were being made to improve the safety of

KEY POINTS
Adverse events and medical errors are common.
Disclosure promotes transparency, accountability, and validation
of the patient's emotional experience after an adverse event or
medical error.
A structured approach to disclosure fosters clear and accurate
communication between health care providers and patients.
Health care providers can become second victims of an adverse
event or medical error, sometimes with tragic consequences.
Resources exist to identify, protect, and support second victims.

CLINICAL VIGNETTE
During placement of a central line, a syringe labeled heparin 100 units/mL
was filled with 1000 units/mL heparin. As a result, a child received
approximately 2500 units of heparin when the catheter was flushed. The
error was traced back to a breakdown in communication among team
members. All members were experienced personnel but had only recently
started working together. The person setting up the tray believed the heparin
would be diluted before use. The physician who flushed the catheter
believed the heparin had already been diluted.
INTRODUCTION
Teamwork is an essential part of modern health care. No single individual
can create all the supplies needed for patient care, possess all the knowledge
needed for their effective use, or provide continuous 24/7 coverage over an
extended period. As a result, patient care depends on a vast network of
people, processes, and technologies. Whitt et al. found that between 17 and
26 different frontline personnel cared for a patient during a typical
hospitalization1 and each of these frontline workers is supported by an even
larger array of ancillary personnel and medical devices. The information
needed to coordinate care grows exponentially as teams enlarge and the
number of possible interventions increases. Viewed from this perspective, it
is not surprising that breakdowns in communication and teamwork are the
most common causes of untoward hospital events.2
Like safety and quality, communication and teamwork are properties of
the system. Recruiting and retaining motivated, skilled individuals are no
guarantee of good communication or effective teams. Rather, health care
systems should be designed to promote and continually improve these traits.
Although teamwork and communication are highly interdependent, this
chapter will separately review the fundamental principles of each. The goal
is to better understand the pathophysiology of dysfunctional teams and poor
communication. The hope is that once diagnosed, these maladies can be
remedied using tools and strategies for improvement.
MEMBERS 
OF 
THE 
PATIENT
CARE TEAM
The nucleus of the patient care team is the patient and his/her support
group. Certain illnesses and conditions exceed the capabilities of this core
and prompt the patient to seek assistance from health care professionals. On
arrival at the medical facility, the team rapidly expands and includes
everyone the patient encounters along the journey. This often includes the
hospital's 
parking 
lot 
attendants, 
receptionists, 
nurses, 
doctors,
technologists, pharmacists, housekeepers, and a support group that includes
lab technicians, administrators, and manufacturers of medical supplies.
Patients expect all these team members to seamlessly coordinate their
efforts. However, given the large number of people involved in even the
simplest health care system, personnel are organized into multiple different
small teams that work in different microsystems.3 Hospitals are
macroscopic systems where multiple different microsystems collaborate
around patient care activities.
BENEFITS OF TEAMWORK
While performance at the individual level is determined by planning and
execution,4,5 teamwork requires coordinated execution of shared plans. In
almost any clinical situation, high-performance teams greatly exceed the
capabilities of individuals, no matter their skill, intelligence, or dedication.6
Teams create robust plans by aggregating the knowledge spread across
numerous individuals, especially in situations where there is no single best
answer or course of action.7,8 Such “wickedly complex problems” are best
addressed by diverse teams who use their varying perspectives to analyze
the situation and devise solutions.9 For example, teams provide valuable
insight into the vulnerabilities of the current system if asked to imagine
there was a catastrophic event in their area and describe the circumstances
that led up to that event.10 Teams coordinate their actions and are capable of
greater vigilance over extended periods by cross-checking one another or
dividing attention to focus on different sources of information.11
Coordinated execution of shared plans requires team members to share
their individual plans or mental models.12 The resulting shared mental
models describe the actions needed to transform inputs into outputs for
each segment of the overall process. For each step, team members are able
to observe each other's actions, and thus, actions are readily communicated.
In contrast, the plans or mental models that drive those actions are held
internally. Resolving the differences between each team member's mental
model requires substantial investments in communication. As a result, the
formation of high-performing teams is difficult.13 Teams require time to
coalesce, work through differences, and improve their performance (Fig.
15-1).
Figure 15-1 Timelines of team development. Individuals form working
groups where actions are largely independent. Initial stages of team
development typically lead to decreases in overall performance, and in
some cases, it may be better to retain working groups rather than attempt to
form teams. The accompanying stages of team development were first
described by Tuckman.14
CHARACTERISTICS 
OF
EFFECTIVE TEAMS
Teams start as a collection of individuals or informal workgroups.
Performance typically declines during early stages of team development.
This failure to immediately improve, while predictable, can lead individuals
to ignore teammates and strike out on his/her own. While such behaviors
might seem justified at the time, they lead to dysfunctional teams. Building
teams starts with creating trust13,15 and then proceeds through additional
stages (Fig. 15-2).
Figure 15-2 Factors influencing team development. Multiple authors
emphasize the importance of trust as a prerequisite condition for creating
effective teams.13,15 Subsequent factors build on that foundation.
Successful teams are built upon trust. Different definitions of trust
include attributes such as confidence, integrity, and predictability. A
modicum of trust accompanies every new interpersonal relationship and
accounts for the honeymoon period that occurs with any new team. When
trust is reinforced via demonstrations of integrity, intent, and capabilities,
teamwork improves. However, trust can be lost more quickly than it is
gained. This asymmetry helps explain the fragility of teams and the relative
scarcity of high-performing teams. The time required to build trust also
accounts for decreased organizational performance during periods of high
employee turnover.16,17
Conflict is a key driver for improved performance. Constructive conflict
prompts individuals to share and revise the mental models they use to solve
the tasks at hand. High-performing teams possess shared mental models that
include lessons learned from prior experiences and contingency plans for
uncommon situations. While a moderate level of conflict is beneficial, too
little or too much conflict is detrimental (Fig. 15-3). Too little conflict
creates an artificial harmony and means that opportunities to improve
mental models are missed. Too much conflict often degrades into personal
attacks that degrade trust. Excessive conflict also diverts both time and
energy from problem solving to conflict resolution.
Figure 15-3 Conflict continuum. Lencioni identified conflict as a key factor
in improving team performance but hypothesized that there is an ideal level
of conflict.13
Successful teams are committed to shared goals. This includes buy-in
where individuals agree to a decision but do not naturally support it. Such
buy-in does not signal group consensus or individual resignation. Rather,
buy-in reflects an open-minded willingness to follow a path proposed by a
teammate. The team's ability to disagree but commit must be matched by
clarity of goals. Too often, discussion ends before teams develop a shared
understanding of goals and their impact on each every member of the team.
While clearly written goals reduce ambiguity, different viewpoints can
persist. Lack of detail and linkage to real-world scenarios causes confusion.
Even in cases of complete agreement, drift occurs over time and as goals
are communicated throughout an organization.
In high-performance teams, team members hold each other accountable
for the performance standards set by the group. Peer pressure and the fear
of letting down a trusted teammate are strong motivators. They typically
carry more weight within the organization than reprimands emanating from
outside the team. Such accountability starts with the team's leader. The
leader's actions must be congruent with the team's goals. Even small
differences between the leader's actions and commitments undermine trust.
The leader sets the tone and should invite feedback from team members. In
this way, teams can begin overcoming the hesitancy that naturally
accompanies the need to provide unflattering feedback.
Successful teams focus on results. They measure achievement by team
success rather than individual honors. While any attempt to measure overall
team performance can raise questions about which metric to use and how
exactly it should be measured, there are no substitutes for measuring key
indicators and sharing them with the team. Teams often establish their own
means of measuring success. Over time, they refine their measurement
methodologies and revise their goals.
Team Knowledge and Leadership
Studies of how teams learn, retain, and transfer knowledge suggest that
teams learn through experience and store their knowledge in people,
processes, and technology.16 Performance suffers when useful knowledge is
lost either through personnel turnover or forgetting past lessons. Written
processes and technology are tools that promote knowledge retention.
However, in contrast to other disciplines, health care teams rarely describe
everyday tasks and the mental models used to perform those tasks in
sufficient detail for a new team member to step in and immediately perform
a complex task. Rather, health care retains a guild-like structure where key
knowledge is held by individuals.18 In contrast to the explicit knowledge
found in written protocols and technology, implicit knowledge is passed
from master to student via extended apprenticeships. While explicit
descriptions promote knowledge transfer and teamwork via induction of
shared mental models, attempts to transfer implicit knowledge is inefficient
and often results to different team members possessing conflicting mental
models.12 A key advantage of embedding knowledge in technology is that
device development creates an explicit description of the problem and
solution. For example, surgeons once handcrafted enteric anastomoses, and
now, they use stapling devices. The current devices benefit from an
accumulating corpus of explicit knowledge and provide a more
standardized, efficient, and effective solution. Teams lose a member's
implicit knowledge when that individual leaves or retires. In contrast, the
knowledge stored in written processes and technology is readily transferred
across time and space to other team members and other teams. Such sharing
often promotes acceleration of organizational learning.16
Members of high-functioning teams continually share and analyze
information. These activities promote a shared understanding that has been
termed “collective mindfulness.”19,20 Such awareness repeatedly compares
predicted to observed performance. Predictable performance arises from
standard work, especially when standard work is accompanied by explicit
description of its steps and their rationale. In contrast, repeatedly using a
nonstandard approach to standard work promotes a normalization of
deviance.21 Mindfulness identifies such variances and searches for an
explanation. These approaches have been used to improve team
performance in health care and other settings.20,22
Team members turn to named and unnamed leaders to organize work,
resolve conflicts, provide examples, and monitor overall progress. Named
leaders appear on organizational charts while unnamed leaders toil in the
background. Since effective teams tend to be small (<10 members), all but
the smallest organizations will have multiple opportunities for individuals
to step into leadership roles. Like any complex behavior, the knowledge,
skills, and abilities to lead are not innate qualities but rather learned through
experience and training. A detailed discussion of leadership is beyond the
scope of this chapter. Interested readers are referred to other texts on
leadership23,24 and leadership development.25
COMMUNICATION
Communication is an essential component of health care in general and
teamwork in particular. Despite widespread acknowledgment of its
importance, communication in health care is rarely defined. This occurs
even though communication is a well-developed scientific discipline built
upon rigorous theory.26–28 A brief review of communication theory is
provided to create a framework for understanding how breakdowns in
communication occur and might be avoided.
Communication involves transmitting information across time and
space. This includes conveying a physician's orders to the pharmacy or a
procedure's risks, benefits, and alternatives to a patient. In each case, the
sender attempts to communicate information to a recipient. Claude Shannon
defined information by its ability to reduce uncertainty in the recipient.26–28
In cases where the recipient is completely certain about a topic, there is no
need to communicate. Predetermined instructions approach such certainty,
and in those circumstances, communication focuses on when to begin
executing those instructions. With standardized work, a long and
complicated set of instructions can be reduced to “start now.” Given that
such certainty rarely exists in health care settings, a more common verbal
exchange between experienced teammates is “start antibiotics on
admission.” The recipient then uses their pre-existing knowledge of patient
variables, clinical settings, and prior examples to unpack the message and
transform it into drug, dose, route, and schedule for a particular patient.
ENCODING, 
TRANSMITTING,
DECODING
In each case, information was encoded by the sender, transmitted from
sender to recipient, and then decoded by the recipient (Fig. 15-4). Since the
sender wishes to remove uncertainty in the recipient, he/she must have
some understanding of the recipient's mind-set. If the recipient only speaks
Russian, a perfectly clear message in English will not reduce uncertainty in
the recipient. Indeed, it is in the sender's best interest to translate the
intended message into a format that will be properly decoded by the
recipient. When communicating with patients, health care professionals
need to avoid jargon and concepts that are not part of the patient's lexicon
or established mental models.
Figure 15-4 Communication schematic. When ill, patients or their family
members face uncertainty about what might be done to treat their illness or
alleviate its symptoms. Upon arriving upon a diagnosis, the provider
attempts to convey this information. Those instructions are encoded into
text, speech, or gestures and transmitted to the patient or family member.
During transmission, noise is invariably added to the message. The patient
or family member then decodes the message and uses the information to
reduce their uncertainty.
Errors occur during each phase of the message's journey. Encoding and
decoding errors arise when the sender and recipient possess different mental
models. The vignette at the start of this chapter illustrates how small
differences can have clear consequences. Errors also occur during
transmission because noise is inevitably added to the message as it traverses
the time and space separating the sender and recipient. Noisy procedure
rooms and low-resolution fax machines are common examples.
Well-designed communication systems contain processes that detect
errors and take corrective action. The most common error mitigation
strategies involve redundancy. Redundancy occurs when the message is
repeated in the setting of a noisy room. Redundancy also occurs within the
message itself. This combats the noisy room problem and also reduces
encoding and decoding errors. An internally redundant message might state
“heparin flush, 100 units/mL” where both the recipient and sender share a
mental model that the standard concentration for heparin flush in this
setting is 100 units/mL. The longer the message, the more likely it contains
such internal redundancies. Shannon demonstrated this feature by reading a
passage from a book, stopping mid sentence and asking a listener to guess
the next word.27,28
While internal redundancy within the message is one means of
improving communication, feedback is an even more effective strategy. By
requiring that the recipient send a message back, the sender learns that the
message was received and correctly decoded (Fig. 15-5). This is the
philosophy behind strategies that require the recipient to read back the
original message. This strategy still fails if the recipient simply parrots back
the message phonetically. In this case, the message was not decoded by the
recipient. It did not reduce uncertainty. A more effective strategy is to have
the recipient generate a reply where the resulting message indicates a
knowledgeable transformation of the original message's content. This is the
philosophy of teach back strategies where the recipient issues a reply that
makes sense to both parties.
Figure 15-5 Communication and teamwork with shared mental models.
Both the physician and nurse see a patient and review the vital signs. Each
independently forms a mental model of a septic patient who needs
immediate treatment. The physician gives a verbal order but a loud noise in
the room means that the nurse only hears “im_____ hundred Q6.” While in
other circumstances, “im_____” might be interpreted as Imitrex, Imodium,
or immobilization, given that she expected an order for antibiotics, she
correctly decodes “im_____,_____hundred Q6” as “imipenem 500 Q6.”
The nurse then uses their mental model to add information regarding route
and urgency. The nurse also provides feedback to acknowledge receipt of
the message. The feedback message while longer than necessary serves two
purposes. First, it convinces the physician that the original message was
received and correctly interpreted. Second, it acknowledges a shared mental
model that will be used as the basis for further communication about this
patient's care. The steps for encoding and decoding the feedback message
are omitted for the sake of clarity.
BANDWIDTH
Communication requires bandwidth, defined as bits of information/second
that can be transmitted through the communication channel. Bandwidth is
commonly conserved by strategies that group information into chunks.
Abbreviations are an example of this chunking strategy. However, chunking
reduces message redundancy and thereby increases the probability of
communication errors. This is especially true in situations where
nonstandard abbreviations are used. The sender and receiver must have
shared mental models of each chunk. Standard work is a chunking strategy
where complex care plans can be created out of multiple predefined tasks.
This strategy conserves communication bandwidth and is observed anytime
teams must work under time pressure. In the prior example, the verbal order
of “imipenem 500 Q6” is decoded to include urgency of obtaining the first
dose, establishing intravenous (IV) access and standard procedure for
administering the medication.
Bandwidth considerations also describe why error rates increase during
efforts to rapidly transmit information through a constrained channel. In
such situations, the channel can become completely filled with information
flowing from the sender to the recipient. There is little to no bandwidth
available for redundancy within the message and no bandwidth available
for feedback. High-capacity channels allow sufficient bandwidth for
feedback and message redundancy. Stated another way, time constraints
lead to increased errors because the protective effects of feedback and
redundancy are sacrificed. However, in emergent situations, the need for
immediate action can supersede concerns about communication errors. The
time and effort spent invested in creating standard work and fostering high-
performing teams are clearly evident in such situations.
In summary, communication theory not only provides insight into the
difficulty of conveying information but also suggests strategies for
improving team performance. Aircraft carrier operations and other high-
reliability organizations have long leveraged these strategies to improve
outcomes.19 The next section illustrates the challenges of applying this
knowledge to patient care. The final section describes the results of
different improvement strategies.
BARRIERS 
TO 
EFFECTIVE
TEAMWORK 
AND
COMMUNICATION
As stated earlier in the chapter, teamwork and communication are critical to
error prevention. The study of accident causation and analyses conducted
after serious safety events point to breakdown of teamwork, often
associated with lack of effective leadership, human factors, and
communication, as being commonly reported root causes of events resulting
in patient harm (Table 15-1).
TABLE 15-1 Top Three Identified Causes of Sentinel Events Reviewed by
the 
Joint 
Commission 
by 
Year
Barriers to team effectiveness referenced in this chapter include time
constraints, poor communication, inflexible hierarchy, conflicting goals,
personnel turnover, and differences in organizational culture. Human factors
is discussed in Chapter 16. People more easily relate to time barriers and
interruptions but dysfunctional behaviors are harder to acknowledge and
address. Organizational culture is understood through the attitudes, beliefs,
and values that shape group behaviors and can strongly influence a group's
ability to perform in a reliably safe manner. Detailed analysis of safety
culture is found in Chapter 12 but here, it is discussed in the context of its
impact on teamwork and communication. Cultures are also unique to local
groups within the macrosystem and can differ from department to
department.
For teams to thrive, they must be supported by not only local leadership
but an organizational culture that promotes collaboration and honest,
respectful communication. A commonly seen barrier is the traditional
hierarchy of medicine, which can inhibit effective teamwork through
promoting a division of labor (silos) where individuals are rewarded for
solo performance instead of successful teamwork. This traditional culture
also continues to foster a power distance and authority gradient, which
erodes healthy teamwork. Power distance is defined as the acceptance by
subordinates that power is distributed unequally, which is a barrier to the
safety strategy “deference to expertise.” This describes the idea that
firsthand observation can often supersede the skill, knowledge, and abilities
of off-site personnel who would otherwise be considered authorities on the
subject. This realization motivates high-reliability organizations to move
decisions to the front line whenever possible.19
The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) defines the
authority gradient as the balance of decision-making power or the steepness
of command hierarchy in a given situation. These concepts can translate as
team members' reluctance to accept the alerts or insights of all teammates,
deferring instead to an unspoken authority gradient. This phenomenon often
allows those with more power to “rule” in a given situation even if there is
known risk in that ruler's decision. Power distance and authority gradient
may be the underlying issue seen in many cases where, during cause
analysis interviews, concerned team members admit that they were afraid to
voice their concerns, especially to anyone with more authority. In the 2005
study, Silence Kills, VitalSmarts, and the American Association of Critical-
Care Nurses found that 84% of nurses and physicians reported observing
colleagues taking dangerous shortcuts when working with patients, and yet,
<10% were willing to speak up about their concerns.29
Residents and students encounter situations where speaking up about
concerns is simply not the norm. In hierarchical cultures, where those less
powerful perceive they will be ignored or even punished for “speaking up
for safety,” silence and divided loyalties can result in patient harm. This is
especially true if medical staff and hospital employees have different
agendas or divergent mental models.
A common example occurs when one team member suspects a foreign
body may be unintentionally left in a wound. That member would request a
radiograph to assess this possibility. The surgeon is anxious to complete the
procedure because there is an urgent request to evaluate a patient in the
emergency room. Each team member is attempting to optimize the situation
to fit their mental model of what will best serve all patients in the system.
Teamwork means communicating and balancing the competing agendas.
Competing priorities such as time constraints are often the cited reason
for lack of compliance with safety policies. Policies and standard work are
developed with the intent of ensuring that the patient's safety is never
compromised for the convenience of their care providers. For this reason,
high-performing teams often discuss or simulate these common situations
before they occur and agree on a flexible, balanced approach to policy
adherence that considers the needs of the patients first then all other team
members.
Patients and families are a significant part of the equation and the most
important members of the health care team. This requires our consideration,
as providers, of their experience with power distance and authority gradient.
In health care, physicians are generally placed at the top of the hierarchy
with an inferred steep authority gradient relative to the patient and their
family. Similar to but possibly even seen more in health care than other
service industries, people tend to pause before questioning or complaining
about the quality of their care to those delivering it. The cause for this lack
of discussion may be patients' fear of some type of reprisal that could
negatively impact their clinical care. People who are sick and frightened are
in a vulnerable position, yet many clinicians are still reluctant to make
changes that would balance the power in the patient–provider relationship.
For example, inviting patients and family to be part of rounds where goals
and plans of care are openly discussed might promote a subjective
evaluation of our knowledge and practices by those we assume are less
knowledgeable. The Joint Commission's National Patient Safety Goals and
accreditation standards state that “an individual's involvement in care
decisions is not only an identified right but also a source of accurate
assessment and treatment information.” These standards direct us to
develop such partnerships with patients and break the traditional paradigm
that has been more provider than patient focused.30
A Health Affairs policy brief provides a multidimensional framework
for patient and family engagement in health and health care that outlines
three 
levels 
of 
participation: 
consultation, 
involvement, 
and
partnership/shared leadership. In consultation, the patient receives
information about their diagnosis, involvement means the patient is asked
about their preferences in developing a treatment plan, and true partnership
is demonstrated by treatment decisions shaped by patient preferences,
medical evidence, and clinical judgment. The framework includes factors
influencing engagement such as patient beliefs about their role, health
literacy, and education.31
Hierarchy presents yet another challenge to teamwork, which we will
refer to as split hierarchy resulting in conflicting loyalties. Health care
professionals, whether in academic medical centers or community hospitals,
are often faced with dual organizational structures that result in different,
possibly conflicting, goals and priorities. Infrastructure issues can affect
resources, teamwork, and communication. Faculty members/attending
physicians report to a departmental leader while nurses, technologists, and
other staff take direction from the hospital's chain of command. Community
hospitals' medical staff is often made up of physicians in private practice
who find the hospital administration competing for time, resources, and
even patients, which create financial challenges for both sides. Strategic
goals and objectives may differ putting team members in a position of split
loyalty and role confusion. For example, a school of medicine may set
research and education as the top priority while the hospital is interested in
driving volumes and services not aligned with the school's research agenda.
Clinical researchers may find it hard to focus team partners on research
tasks when those employees are mandated to meet productivity goals set by
hospital supervisors.
Diverse communication styles are another potential barrier to safe
teamwork. Gender, age, and cultural and language differences can often
negatively impact team members' ability to deliver and/or receive accurate
messages. Communication patterns are shaped by personal and professional
education, training, and experience where role models, often unknowingly,
teach us to be compatible or dysfunctional team players. Organizational
culture type also plays an important role in how teams function. In
hierarchical and, worse, pathologic cultures, problems or weaknesses are
swept under the carpet for fear of a punitive response. Conversely, learning
organizations adopt a collaborative culture that promotes open, honest
communication and encourages those who speak up about risk.
From the perspective of any team member, effective communication is
further hampered by lack of formal training in respectful assertion
techniques. Assertion assumes that individuals will speak up and state their
information or questions with appropriate persistence until there is clear
resolution. Assertion is blocked by the same overall communication barriers
of power distance, lack of shared mental model, lack of confidence, and
past experiences (especially if intimidation has been part of one's
experience). Employing standard methods of communication that provides
the right amount/type of useful information and advocating for team
members when intimidation is witnessed are helpful strategies that will be
covered further in the table of error prevention tools at the end of this
chapter.
CREATING 
MORE 
EFFECTIVE
TEAMS
Teamwork training programs have been a force in improving reliability. Not
only checklists and care bundles promote shared mental models but also
they foster development of a safety culture. Over the last decade, beginning
with the Institute for Healthcare Improvement's (IHI) 100,000 Lives
Campaign (2005), teams have learned to bundle evidence-based prevention
measures and use checklists to improve patient care. Implementation
experience teaches us that bundles and checklists alone are not the answer
to safer care because these tools were created for individuals that can decide
to ignore or not fully implement them. Knowing what shapes individuals'
willingness to comply with safety behaviors (human factors) and the
influence of functional teams is a critical success factor in improving
clinical quality and safety, an unending journey.
The Comprehensive Unit-Based Safety Program (CUSP) has been
celebrated as a successful teamwork initiative that improved care for
patients in intensive care units (ICUs) across the US. This effort integrated
the focus on compliance with clinical bundles to reduce catheter-associated
bloodstream infections (CLABSI) and the fundamental cultural issues that
could promote adoption of safe practices. The combination of clinical and
cultural interventions helped to bridge the divide or power distance among
diverse patient care partners. Administrative leadership commitment, strong
team leaders, and educated accountable team members worked together in
hundreds of ICUs all over the country to realize an almost 40% reduction in
CLABSI. The safety climate survey conducted in participating ICUs
reported that the strongest predictor of clinical excellence (metric: zero
CLABSI for 5 months or greater) was that caregivers felt comfortable
speaking up if they perceived a problem with patient care.32 ICU staff,
physicians, and hospital administrators were trained on teamwork
competencies, which included (1) mutual performance monitoring and
adaptability [situational awareness], (2) supporting/backup behavior, (3)
effective team leadership, (4) task-related assertiveness, (5) conflict
resolution, and (6) closed-loop communication.33 Other programs, such as
TeamSTEPPS (Strategies and Tools to Enhance Performance and Patient
Safety) and Team Performance Plus, have brought principles of high
reliability to health care teams, emphasizing the positive effects of
teamwork and communication.
Leader methods for reliability and safety behaviors demonstrated by use
of error prevention tools are the foundation for improving the culture of
safety, improved teamwork and communication, and reduction in harm.
Error prevention tools are aimed at the causes for and types of human error
(skill-based, knowledge-based, and rule-based). Examples and strategies for
improving communication as well as assertiveness are summarized in
Tables 15-2 to 15-5.

TECHNOLOGIES 
FOR 
SELF-
ORGANIZING TEAMS
The traditional command and control model relied on centralized expertise
and a hierarchical infrastructure to broadcast information to frontline teams.
Collaborative models promote conversations as a means of sharing
information with frontline staff. Dynamic situations such as managing a
critically ill patient or working urgent/emergent patients into an existing
schedule require ongoing reassessment and reformulation of plans.
Whiteboards and similar technologies have long been used to manage
dynamic systems. These vehicles allow multiple workers to continually
update the posted information about the system's state. Recently,
whiteboards and similar tools have been introduced into ICUs with
encouraging results. While a series of one-to-one conversations were
previously used to organize the care of critically ill patients, these
whiteboards are a more efficient means of creating a shared mental model
about the patient's condition and planned interventions. In addition, written
information supports asynchronous communication where even though
one's attention might be distracted for a period, the information remains
accessible. In contrast, verbal communication requires attention and proper
sequencing.
Electronic versions of these whiteboards promote even greater visibility
of the system's state. Such transparency eliminates phone calls that were
previously required to manage workflow and adjust staffing levels to
accommodate schedule changes. Networked versions of electronic
whiteboards constitute a type of wiki, where a wiki is a website that allows
visitors to make changes, contributions, or corrections. Wikipedia.com is
the best known example of a wiki. While subject matter experts will always
have concerns about the accuracy and reliability of the information posted
by large, diverse groups of authors, wikis are more responsive to rapidly
changing events.35–38 Wikis and whiteboards leverage the realization that

frontline staff and other first person observers are the de facto experts when
it comes to evaluating the local situation.
KEY POINTS
Teamwork in patient care is essential. The team includes the
patient, all care providers, and support personnel.
Team performance depends on shared mental models and
communication. Both benefit from experience working together
as a team.
Communication can be divided into three steps: message
encoding, transmission, and decoding.
Communication errors fall into common patterns. Redundancy,
feedback, and constructing the message with the recipient in mind
are proven prevention strategies.

CLINICAL VIGNETTE
Ms. W is a 50-year-old woman with lymphoma admitted for a stem cell
transplant. She also has a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular
rate for which she is on an esmolol drip and has a cardiac monitor. The
monitor is located at the bedside, and the display of the cardiac rhythm can
be viewed at the bedside but is also transmitted to the nurses' station. This
evening, the patient had a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line
placed by the intravenous (IV) therapy service. While setting up her
equipment to place the PICC line, the IV therapist accidentally bumped the
bedside cardiac monitor, causing a cord on the back of the monitor to
become unplugged. This caused the monitor to alarm. The IV therapist
plugged the cord back into the back of the monitor, the alarm stopped, and
the heart rhythm could again be seen at the bedside. The PICC line was then
placed without incident. Later in the evening, one of the nurses noted that
the patient's monitor was no longer transmitting to the nurses' station. She
entered the patient's room, found her to be in asystole, and called a code.
During the code, it was noted that the cord on the monitor had been plugged
into the incorrect port. When the cord is plugged into this port, the heart
rhythm can be viewed at the bedside but is not transmitted to the nurses'
station. When it is plugged into the correct port, the rhythm can be viewed
in both locations. The incorrect port was color-coded orange; the plug was
green. However, the ports were not easily visible. Even if ports were visible
and the color coding matched, the lighting was dim making visibility of
color difficult.

How did the design of the equipment or room contribute to the event?

INTRODUCTION
Human Factors Engineering (HFE) (also called Ergonomics) is a discipline
that conducts research regarding human psychological, social, physical, and
biologic characteristics and works to apply that information with respect to
the design, operation, or use of products or systems that optimize human
performance, health, safety, and/or habitability.1 The following is the
definition most widely adopted by the HFE community, developed by the
International Ergonomics Association2:
“Ergonomics (or human factors) is the scientific discipline concerned with
the understanding of interactions among humans and other elements of a
system, and the profession that applies theory, principles, data and methods
to design in order to optimize human well-being and overall system
performance.”
The term human factors is sometimes used as a misnomer by attributing the
cause of an error to a human action. However, the science of HFE rejects
the premise that the human is primarily at fault and instead utilizes a
systems approach to fully understand the circumstance that leads to an
error.3 In the clinical vignette, according to HFE, the cause of the error was
the presence of two nonfunctioning ports, rather than the nurse's action (Fig.
16-1). The solution was focused on the system (the cardiac monitor) rather
than the user (nurse). Systems are invented by humans and, hence, should
be designed for humans to use them correctly. Any error that occurs by the
user is thus attributable to the design of the system.4
Figure 16-1 HFE intervention on a cardiac monitor.
HFE began as a formal discipline after World War II, primarily in the
military and aviation domains before moving into other industries in the
1970s.4–6 Events in other industries such as the “Three Mile Island” nuclear
accident in the US and the “Bhopal gas tragedy” in India resulted in several
regulatory documents outlining how HFE must systematically be
incorporated in system design. HFE has been utilized in health care to a
small degree since the 1980s; however, HFE became more prominent in
health care during the 1990s with the shift in culture away from “blaming
the user” and the identification of active (user) and latent (systems)
failures.7
There are three HFE core principles that have been applied to health
care8,9:
1. Systems Orientation—Performance results from the interaction of a
sociotechnical system instead of a single component (user).
2. Design Driven—Improvements directed toward the design of work
environment, equipment, structures, and processes.
3. Person Centered—Systems should be designed to support the needs of
the people using the system.
The foundation for HFE is based on the domains of physical, cognitive, and
organizational (psychosocial) characteristics of people.10 A few examples of
these domains include:
Cognitive Ergonomics—Includes mental workload, decision making,
human–computer interaction, human reliability, stress, and training.
These concepts can be used in health care to evaluate the usability of
technology, design training systems, and user interfaces for
information 
technology. 
Cognitive 
issues 
are 
critical 
when
understanding incident or event reporting systems and analysis
processes.
Physical Ergonomics—Includes material handling, posture, repetition,
workplace layout, and physical capabilities (all senses). These
concepts can be used in health care to reduce worker and patient
injuries and achieve optimal workplace (sound, lighting, glare, noise)
and equipment layouts. Physical issues must be considered to achieve
safe patient care.
Organizational 
Ergonomics—Includes 
communication, 
job/work
design, shift work, participatory design, teamwork, policies,
procedures, and quality management. These concepts can be used in
health care to design jobs that will reduce stress and burnout and
improve patient and staff satisfaction. Organizational issues must be
considered when designing patient care models to achieve appropriate
work schedules and enhance worker performance and processes.
Factors that negatively affect human performance and can be addressed
during an HFE assessment are shown in Table 16-1.

Performance
FRAMEWORKS AND MODELS
Applied Model
A systems approach for applying the domains of HFE into practice involves
numerous disciplines, but for practical purposes, they can be grouped into
three components: Organization, Human, and Environmental (Fig. 16-2).
When an error or inefficiency occurs, it is usually the result of some
combination of these components.
Figure 16-2 Practical application of a Human Factors Systems Approach.
Organization: Even when individual components of a system are
designed with HFE in mind, it is still possible for an undesired
outcome to occur if the design of the entire work system is not
considered. Macroergonomics is a subdiscipline of HFE that studies
the overall work system.10 The study of macroergonomics concludes
that for human factors to be effective, there is a need to integrate
organization and management into the system design process.
Human Capabilities and Limitations: A mismatch between physical
abilities and job demands can lead to physical discomfort and injury. A
mismatch with cognitive capabilities and perception abilities can lead
to frustration and error.
Physical Capabilities: To understand the physical capabilities and
limitations of humans requires knowledge of the size, strength,
and physical activities of the person performing a specific task.
Engineering anthropometry deals with the application of scientific
physical measurement methods to develop engineering design
standards. This field includes static and functional (dynamic)
measurements of postural dimensions, forces, and energy
expenditures. Numerous tables of data are available with various
human populations that typically indicate the 5th, 50th, and 95th
percentiles for dimensions such as standing height, seated height
and width, leg length, etc.6 Anthropometric data can be applied to
the design of equipment and facilities to produce health care
environments and processes that fit the physical capabilities of
health care workers and their patients.
Cognitive Capabilities: There are numerous considerations when
understanding the mental processes that occur during a work task.
Cognitive issues are a significant source of errors in health care.11
Perception: There are limitations with each of the five senses in
recognition of various stimuli. Some common perceptual issues in
health care are described in Table 16-2.
The design and implementation of technology into health care
have raised numerous cognitive concerns such as usability of
medical devices and cognitive workload. A health care worker is
required to interact daily with multiple computer interfaces and
information communication systems. Appropriate menu screen
design and hierarchy access to information become critical as
electronic medical records are becoming more complex and
essential in communication. Another common problem is the
overload of auditory and visual alarms that can lead to
desensitization and ignoring alarms.
Environment: The environment can be thought of in two categories.
The first category includes the physical space where work is
performed. This includes the immediate workstation, intermediate
settings such as the building where work occurs, and more generally
the community or city. The second category includes various aspects
of the ambient environment such as illumination, noise, heat, cold,
vibration, and pollution.

Issues 
in 
Health 
care
All of these environmental factors can interact to impact how one functions
within the health care setting. For example, one intensive care unit (ICU)
found that individuals frequently walked into the glass door to enter the
unit. The hallway entering the ICU was white. The glass door had a white
label applied to the glass. The lack of contrast between the white lettering
and the white background combined with the glare from the hallway lights
made it very difficult to read the sign. Increasing the contrast of the label by
utilizing a dark background and white letters increased the readability of the
sign significantly.
SEIPS Model
An HFE model of person-centered sociotechnical systems that has been
extensively used in health care is called Systems Engineering Initiative for
Patient Safety (SEIPS). It was introduced by Carayon et al. in 200613 and
developed at the University of Wisconsin. This model has been adopted by
patient safety leaders and used to frame the design and analysis of research
in the field. An updated version of the model has been proposed by Holden
et al.9 called SEIPS 2.0 (Fig. 16-3).
Figure 16-3 SEIPS 2.0 model by Holden et al. (From Holden RJ, et al.
SEIPS 2.0: a human factors framework for studying and improving the
work 
of 
healthcare 
professionals 
and 
patients. 
Ergonomics.
2013;56(11):1669–86.)
The structure of the SEIPS 2.0 model as depicted below proposes that a
sociotechnical work system (LEFT) produces certain work processes
(CENTER), which shape the outcomes (RIGHT). It includes feedback loops
from the outcomes to the other two components, called adaptation
(BOTTOM), in order to improve the outcomes.
Work System—Composed of six interacting components: person(s),
tasks, tools and technologies, organization, internal environment, and
external environment. All components revolve around the Person,
emphasizing that design should support the people involved including
health care providers, patients, and family.
Processes—This is the workflow and can be classified as physical,
cognitive, or social/behavioral performance processes. There are
different agents that lead in each process including professionals,
patients, or a collaboration of both.
Outcomes—The outcomes are the results from the work processes that
reflect the goals of the different stakeholders including patients, health
care professionals, and leaders of the organization. Outcomes of a
process can be desirable or undesirable and immediate (proximal) or
reflected in the future (distal).
Adaptation—Adaptation refers to changes due to feedback from the
outcomes. Adaptations are inevitable in complex sociotechnical
systems and can be intended or unintended, reactive or planned, and
short or long lasting.
For a more detailed explanation of the SEIPS 2.0 model, please refer to the
publication in Ergonomics by Holden et al.9
Published examples of HFE models at
work
There is significant published work about HFE models employed in
different aspects of health care settings. A few of these are included to help
obtain a better grasp of the effects of HFE in health care.
Medical device purchases—HFE research was performed prior to the
purchase of an infusion pump by a facility. Health care providers who
use infusion pumps were videotaped using each of the candidate
devices allowing for the selection of the safest and most person
centered among four commercially available candidates.14
ICU medication administration—This study used an HFE approach to
evaluate potential medication administration failures and contributing
factors. Focus groups of ICU nurses were utilized to identify the
potential failure modes, contributing factors, and recovery processes
used by nurses in the medication administration process. These
findings can be utilized for process redesign.15
Impact of bar-coded medication administration (BCMA)—An HFE
assessment can describe and quantify the desirable and undesirable
impact that the implementation of BCMA can have on a work process.
This study found that a change to BCMA process had both desirable
and undesirable effects.16
HUMAN FACTORS ASSESSMENT
FORM
The assessment form in Table 16-3 is adapted from the Mayo Clinic Human
Factors Analysis and Classification System (HFACS). This form can be
used to assess a work area, or piece of equipment, or even to consider HFE
issues that may have contributed to an adverse event. The assessment
considers the impact of the following characteristics:
TABLE

1. Environment/Layout 2. Environment/Conditions 3. Equipment
(supplies, materials, availability) 4. Equipment Usability (hardware) 5.
Equipment Usability (software) 6. Physical Capabilities and
Limitations 7. Cognitive Capabilities and Limitations 8. Organization
(policies and procedures) 9. Communication
For each of the above characteristics, the assessor can record the score of
the block that best describes the condition of the situation being assessed.
For example, if an audible alarm was missed at the nurse station during a
shift change, the following scores could be considered:
Environmental Layout = 2 (Environment allows task to be
accomplished but achieved with difficulty and many not be accurate.)
Environmental 
Conditions 
= 
2 
(Noise 
levels 
can 
cause
misperceptions.)
Equipment/Supplies = 4 (Equipment needed was available, just
couldn't be heard.)
Equipment Usability = 4 (Audible display was easy to understand, just
couldn't be heard.)
In this example, it shows the environmental conditions were more
responsible for the missed alarm than the usability or human characteristics
(like physical or mental capabilities).
This assessment form can be used proactively to predict what may
contribute to an error or reactively after an error has occurred. During error
debriefings, the form can ensure many aspects of human factors are
considered during the discovery/diagnostic phase to achieve an
understanding of causation.
CONCLUSION
HFE provides the opportunity for health care workers to identify challenges
with performing a task without assuming it is their fault. Often, the
designers of a technology do not realize the frequency of interruptions,
multitasking, and complexity of the environment where the task is
performed. Introducing the rigor of HFE into health care will allow greater
systemic solutions to some of the challenges in the health care
environment.4
KEY POINTS
Human factors should be incorporated into system design.
Minimize “work-arounds” in the process.
Avoid mental, physical, or sensory overload.

CLINICAL VIGNETTE
Dr. P is a previously healthy 80-year-old retired medical school professor,
who lives at home with his wife of 55 years and plays tennis twice weekly.
He takes a daily aspirin and medication for his hypertension but denies any
prior hospitalizations or surgeries. He presents to the emergency department
(ED) after a syncopal episode while walking from his car to the tennis
court. Witnesses noted no seizure-like activity, postsyncope confusion, or
other sequelae from the fainting episode. He is awake and alert with no fall-
related injuries. He notes no pain or any other complaint on physical exam.
His workup is unremarkable, including a normal chest x-ray,
electrocardiogram, hemoglobin, chemistries, and cardiac enzymes. While
assessing a level I patient and whisking another patient with an ST-segment
elevation myocardial infarction to the cardiac catheterization lab, the ED
physician contemplates the most likely and immediately life-threatening
diagnostic possibilities. The last three syncope patients that she managed
were ultimately diagnosed with pulmonary embolism (PE), one at the time
of autopsy 2 days after discharge. However, the Choosing Wisely Campaign
has heightened clinician's attention to the phenomenon of overdiagnosis and
pseudodiagnosis. Therefore, after determining that the patient is at moderate
risk for PE with a validated risk stratification rule, the ED physician orders
a ventilation–perfusion (V/Q) scan rather than a PE protocol computed
tomography (CT) noting significantly reduced radiation dose to the patient
via the former study. Before obtaining the V/Q scan, the patient inquires
about whether the V/Q scan identifies aortic dissection since his younger
brother died of one last year. You discuss the limitations of V/Q for non-PE
diagnoses and the risks of CT with the professor who opts for the CT scan,
which subsequently demonstrates a type I aortic dissection for which you
promptly call thoracic surgery.

INTRODUCTION
Cognitive errors in medicine are neither infrequent nor restricted to the
hectic ED where errors leading to delayed diagnosis are the most frequent
subtype.1–4 The lay press is recognizing the imperfections in physician
decision making with increasing frequency.5–8 Unfortunately, traditional
medical school, resident, and continuing medical education neglect the
“black box” of cognitive reasoning.9 Incorporating decision making into
medical education at any level is challenging because the “black box” of
cognitive concepts lacks objective tests of presence and nobody has
demonstrated the ability to efficiently reduce error or alter physician's
behavior by understanding these constructs.10–12 Further, traditional
medical education through such delivery systems as “Morbidity and
Mortality” conferences focuses on a lack of professional acumen on the
physician's part.13 Conference participants often receive feedback that a
missed diagnosis is the worst error a doctor can make.14 On the other hand,
health care providers receive little objective, evidence-based internal or
external feedback on their practice behavior, leading to an environment
where overtesting may receive positive re-enforcement. For example,
excessive testing is associated with increased revenue and decreased
malpractice risk reinforcing the mind-set that higher resource utilization
equates to higher-quality medical care.15,16 Diagnostic failure represents
one major oversight of the Institute of Medicine (IOM) report To Err Is
Human.17,18 For example, the term “medication error” appears 70 times in
the IOM report in contrast to the term “diagnostic error,” which appears
only twice.19
The first step to understanding the intellectual process that occurs
between the initial patient contact (a constellation of symptoms, risk
factors, and available tests) and identification of the etiology is to review
decision-making models. The study of cognitive reasoning continues to
evolve with an expanding awareness that effective patient safety strategies
and curricula require an understanding of the cognitive models that
traditionally fall within the realm of psychologists.20–22
CLINICAL 
DECISION-MAKING
MODELS
Philosophers, cognitive psychologists, and decision-making experts catalog
and define multiple constructs for misleading pathways to achieving “truth”
(http://www.fallacyfiles.org/taxonomy.html). We summarize these logical
fallacies in Table 17-1. Most early research about decision making occurred
in nonmedical fields, but over the last decade, these theories have moved
into the fields of medicine and medical education.9,10 Acquisition of
professional expertise in music, athletics, writing, or other skill-based tasks
like medical decision making requires appropriate mentoring and deliberate
practice.23,24 Health care providers' understanding of their internal decision-
making process, what they are thinking while they are thinking, is called
metacognition.25 One component of metacognition is understanding the
conscious and subconscious framework upon which clinical reasoning
occurs.
TABLE 
17-1 
Subtypes 
of 
Logical 
Fallacies
A variety of cognitive process theoretical constructs exist, though proving
their existence and measuring their prevalence and impact are
challenging.20,26 In decision-dense, time-deprived environments like the
ED, recognition-primed decision making is believed to be most prevalent
(Fig. 17-1).27 The “cognitive checkpoint” in Figure 17-1 is the
determination of whether the patient fits into a previously defined pattern.
This model and other decision-making constructs also fit into the dual-
process model of reasoning26 (Fig. 17-2). The dual-process model consists
of two subtypes that have different confounders and paths to aptitude:
System 1 and System 2. System 1 is driven by underlying intuition, which
is often subconscious and nonanalytical. When disease is recognized using
System 1, the diagnosis is made without recognized awareness using the
unconscious thought theory.26,28 System 1 is referred to as “Augenblink” or
“blink of an eye” by some cognitive psychology authors.29 Experienced
providers will often successfully use clinical gestalt to achieve a diagnosis,
which less experienced providers can only achieve through the use of
Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) checklists.30,31

P, Bond WF. Profiles in patient safety: a “perfect storm” in the emergency
department. Acad Emerg Med. 2007;14(8):743–9.)
System 1 thinking can lead to overconfidence and has multiple potential
“blind spots.” It is possible that these deficiencies can be mitigated by
experience, but completion of residency training may be insufficient.32,33
Traditionally, the majority of cognitive errors were attributed to System 1
problems, although recent research questions this theory.34,35 The
automaticity of System 1 can be confounded by emotion, intrinsic cognitive
biases, and personality.36 Examples of personality issues skewing System I
decision making to err include overconfidence,37 risk tolerance,38
motivation, and cultural milieu. On the other hand, System 2 is the rational
and methodologic approach to appraising a medical situation within the
context of textbooks and research while re-evaluating accuracy based upon
evolving test results and therapeutic response. These influences sometimes
yield irrational behavior that is called dysrationalia.26,39 The two systems
are not mutually exclusive. In fact, effective System 1 decision making
requires System 2 oversight—recognizing when the initial pattern does not
fit 
with 
the 
evolving 
medical 
situation 
and 
altering 
the
diagnostic/therapeutic plan accordingly. System 2 is more time and resource
intense than System 1 and is not immune to error. Decision-maker
characteristics like cognitive indolence and fatigue as well as ambient
environmental conditions like task distractions impede reliable System 2
processes. Disruptions to System 2 decision making increase the risk of
System 1 error by reducing the effectiveness of System 2.26
Experts define a variety of subtypes of clinical decision-making error
from Table 17-1, which we include in Table 17-2.36 Anchoring bias,
confirmation bias, availability bias, base rate neglect, and triage cueing are
particularly prevalent. Strategies to understand individual clinician's
cognitive biases profile include simulation and efforts to capture cognitive
processes during clinical shifts.22,40,41

IMPACT OF FLAWED CLINICAL
DECISION MAKING ON PATIENT
SAFETY
Eliminating diagnostic errors is unrealistic given the complexities of disease
processes, test availability and inherent inaccuracy, as well as
heterogeneous patients and medical providers at the interface of a
constantly evolving health care system.42 However, reducing cognitive
errors 
mandates 
understanding 
the 
prevalence, 
precipitants, 
and
consequences. Early patient safety researchers used retrospective chart
reviews that made it difficult to detect cognitive process failures,
particularly in diagnostics.18 In contrast, medication and procedural errors
are usually clearly visible. Diagnostic errors remain an underappreciated
cause of medical errors. For example, the contemporary Institute for
Healthcare Improvement (IHI) Global Trigger Tool does not identify
diagnostic errors.18,43 Nonetheless, there is a growing body of evidence
pointing toward cognitive errors as a tangible target for patient safety–
focused quality improvement efforts.
One prospective ED-based study of almost 2000 visits found that one-
fifth of reported errors were diagnostic errors.1 Another retrospective ED
study found that half (50%) of unexpected deaths within 7 days were
related to the ED visit and up to 60% may be related to cognitive error.
Barriers ED physicians experience found in this cohort include
interpretation, coexisting substance abuse/intoxication, and patient
characteristics such as severity of disease, psychiatric or neurologic illness,
and poor medical literacy.44 The use of EBM or heuristic checklists is a
possible solution,31 but here, the potential to select the wrong checklist,
known as confirmation bias, is a significant potential error.45 A study of
closed malpractice claims found that the overwhelming cause of the claims
was 
cognitive 
error 
(96%). 
Systems 
issues 
such 
as 
handoff
communications, workload, and supervision were found to combine with
incomplete examinations and inappropriate test ordering or interpretation to
create the situations where harm to patients and subsequent lawsuits
occurred. Of note, most cases in this series found that multiple errors
occurred.2
As noted by Elstein,46 diagnostic errors also occur outside the ED. A
survey of 310 clinicians from 22 institutions suggested that clinicians of all
specialties occasionally recognize problems with cognitive processes. In
this study, 583 diagnostic errors were reported, including 28% rated as
“major” with the most common missed or delayed diagnoses including PE,
drug reactions, cancer, stroke, and acute coronary syndromes.3
COGNITIVE 
DISPOSITIONS 
TO
RESPOND
Cognitive dispositions to respond (CDR) can be thought of as how we as
humans intrinsically process information in order to arrive at a decision.
CDR are intended to be nonpejorative.47 Since it is sometimes challenging
to separate cognition from our emotional state, CDR are often linked with
affective dispositions to respond (ADR). The Morsani Medical College of
Medicine (University of South Florida) trains its medical students with the
pneumonic HALT: Hungry, Angry, Late, Tired. These and other
environmental and intrinsic factors, including physical, emotional, and
psychiatric, can impact a physician's overall disposition to respond or
ability to make a decision.48 In the end, an understanding of both CDR and
ADR, as well as their interplay, is a vital part of understanding how medical
decision-making errors occur.
Since physicians cannot “know everything” about a patients disease (or
health), the ability to be completely rational is limited. One proposed
solution is to limit information and have “bounded rationality”49 and
understand economic motivators50 as a way to make decisions with
incomplete or imperfect information. The issue then lies in where to place
the boundary between sufficient and insufficient information, as its
placement can lead directly to error.
Individual CDRs are the means by which they acquire, analyze, and
interpret these information thresholds. Table 17-2 summarizes many CDRs
and groups similar types of flawed thinking together.36 By understanding
the variety of cognitive errors in medical reasoning, physicians can
incorporate shared decision making. For example, a chest pain patient in the
ED could be shown a card depicting their personal risk of acute coronary
syndrome to reduce prevalence perception errors.51
Traditional medical training vehicles such as the Morbidity and
Mortality conference create a cognitive environment in which the missed
diagnosis is considered much worse than overtesting or overutilization of
resources.52 Based upon a theory whereby complex medical decisions
evolved in an award-based environment, the error management theory
(EMT) implies that efforts to improve clinical decision making face a
challenge much greater than altering medical education.53 Fundamentally,
EMT seeks to explain, often in a Darwinian sense, how bias in decision
making can in the long run lead to improved outcomes. Under EMT,
improving the overall quality and reliability of clinical decision making will
require each physician to unlearn potentially dangerous behaviors that were
previously rewarded. The challenge for patient safety advocates is to find
interventions that overwhelm the reward-based learned behavior. While
recent attempts to improve clinical decision making have been
unsuccessful,12 efforts should continue.
SPECIAL SITUATIONS
Fatigue and Patient Handoffs
Fatigue is a well-recognized cause of errors and subsequent patient safety
issues.54,55 Starting with the Bell Commission in 1989 and ultimately
culminating with widespread Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical
Education (ACGME) regulations in 2003, physicians in training have had
temporal restrictions placed upon them as a means to address this issue.
Recent articles have noted that the decrease in clinical responsibilities has
led to an increase in reported errors.56 This substantiates prior study with
earlier versions of the duty hour rules where medication safety was not
improved, but rather trended in a less safe direction.57 Early speculation
that the lack of increased patient safety stemmed from an increased number
of handoffs was recently confirmed in a study that was terminated early.58
Handoffs in health care allow for multiple cognitive errors.59 The most
obvious transition of care related to cognitive misstep from Table 17-2 is
“inheriting someone else's thinking” errors. Recognizing the importance of
handoff communication, the Joint Commission in 2007 focused on handoff
communication as a National Patient Safety Goal. The SBAR (Situation,
Background, Assessment, Recommendation) model was recommended.60
The ACGME 
has 
also 
recognized 
the 
importance 
of 
handoff
communication as a potential threat to patient safety. The “Clinical
Learning Environment Review” visits which the ACGME now conduct
focus on the following six areas: Patient Safety, Quality Improvement,
Supervision, Duty Hours Oversight/Fatigue Management and Mitigation,
Transitions 
in 
Care, 
and 
Professionalism
(https://www.acgme.org/acgmeweb/Portals/0/PDFs/CLER/CLER_Brochure
.pdf). An institutional approach to improving this aspect of patient care has
recently been described.61
Procedures and Patient Safety
Procedural safety as it relates to patient safety has received recent increased
attention. Traditionally, physicians have focused on the technical aspects of
performing the procedure. For example, one study of lumbar puncture noted
26 major steps, none of which had to do with patient selection,62 disease
probability,63 test–treatment thresholds,64 or other decisions made prior to
performing the procedure.65 Recently, external organizations such as the
Joint Commission seek to mitigate cognitive errors such as diagnosis
momentum (i.e., “the chest tube tray is on the right side so that must be the
side the patient requires the thoracostomy”) using a “time out” as part of a
“Universal 
Protocol”
(http://www.jointcommission.org/standards_information/up.aspx). 
As
another example, the IHI Central Lines bundle focuses on the cognitive
decisions made before and after, rather than during the procedure. Despite
educational theory, which defines competency as a continuum that moves
from unconscious incompetence to unconscious competence, the ACGME
has traditionally defined procedural competence by a number of procedures
performed 
(http://www.gordontraining.com/free-workplace-
articles/learning-a-new-skill-is-easier-said-than-done/).66 The ACGME has
recently moved for all residency training from the Core Competencies to
the Next Accreditation System (NAS), often referred to as the Milestones
Project
(https://www.acgme.org/acgmeweb/tabid/430/ProgramandInstitutionalAccr
editation/NextAccreditationSystem/Milestones.aspx). A stated goal of the
Milestones Project is to codify specific skills that need to be demonstrated.
While this includes the number of expected procedures, there is now also an
emphasis 
on 
the 
decisions 
to 
perform 
the 
procedure
(https://www.acgme.org/acgmeweb/Portals/0/PDFs/Milestones/Emergency
MedicineMilestones.pdf). Some specialties have chosen to describe the
highest level of competence in this framework as an “Entrustable
Professional Activity (EPA),” denoting that a learner can perform the
procedure 
without 
expert 
oversight
(https://www.acgme.org/acgmeweb/Portals/0/PDFs/Milestones/MilestonesF
AQ.pdf).
Critical Thinking in an Emergency
Rapid, urgent, or emergent decision making occurs in many parts of health
care, including but not limited to the operating room, labor and delivery
room, and intensive care units. In the ED, challenges unique to these types
of environments have been described (Table 17-3).67 Shift work intensifies
the handoff issues just discussed and, with the advent of an increasing use
of the “hospitalist” model of care, is relevant not just to the ED but also to
internal 
medicine, 
pediatrics, 
general/trauma 
surgery, 
and
obstetrics/gynecology (OB/GYN), among others. Throughout the inpatient
segment of the health care system, the round-the-clock nature culture may
create not just fatigue but “shift work syndrome.” As health care, especially
inpatient health care, becomes more fragmented, the traditional long-term
physician relationship and the more rational, from a cognitive perspective,
benefits that come with it may become rarer.

KEY POINTS
1. Diagnostic error is underemphasized. Traditional medical
education focuses on only part of the problem and missed
diagnosis and tends to minimize type 1 or false-positive errors.
2. Humans use System 1 (“blink of an eye”), and System 2 processes
to yield clinical decisions. System 1 may be more prone to error,
but the two systems are interdependent.
3. Human CDR are numerous. Evolving toward a safer health care
environment using these theoretical constructs remains a
challenge and will involve behavioral modifications to unlearn
reward-based, ingrained situational responses.
4. In order to improve decision making and patient safety, special
attention should be given to the periprocedural time period, to
provider fatigue and subsequent patient handoffs, and the ED as a
decision-dense environment.

18 Tools to Improve Patient Safety
James J. Fehr and Jason C. Wagner 18
CLINICAL VIGNETTE
A healthy 4-year-old child is scheduled for surgical repair of a left
inguinal hernia. The surgeon obtains informed consent and marks the
surgical site in the preoperative holding area. The child is taken to the
operating room (OR) and anesthetized, and the surgical field is
prepared. Both inguinal areas are prepped and draped, and a time out is
performed prior to the incision. As the time out occurs, music is
playing, conversations are ongoing, and a ringing phone is answered.
The team does not notice that the preoperative marking was
inadvertently cleaned off during the sterile prep. The surgical incision
is made in the right inguinal area. Following dissection, no hernia sac
is identified. The surgeon reviews the clinical documentation and the
error is discovered.
Questions
Why did wrong-sided surgery occur?
What could prevent this from ever happening again?
INTRODUCTION
Early accounts of adverse patient care events stemmed from analyses of the
events that led to medical malpractice claims.1 Further descriptions of
adverse events in hospitalized patients revealed the widespread extent of
these problems.2,3 The increased focus on the causative factors of adverse
events in hospitalized patients and the methods for addressing them has
spurred the entire medical industry toward greater engagement in improving
the health care environment. Over the past several decades, there has been a
drive to improve the safety of patients and a requirement for better tools to
teach optimal safety practices to physicians, to improve clinical care, and to
measure performance and outcomes. Numerous organizations have
spearheaded this effort including the Joint Commission, the Agency for
Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), and the Institute for Healthcare
Improvement (IHI). The focus of the Joint Commission in the 2013
National Patient Safety Goals for hospitals is to make sure that patients are
identified correctly, improve staff communication, use medicines safely,
prevent infection, identify patient safety risks, and prevent surgical
mistakes.4 This has resulted in the development of numerous tools to
educate health care providers and consumers about the complex issues
surrounding patient safety and to assist clinicians in their management of
increasingly complicated patients. Some of these tools are straightforward,
some of the techniques are elaborate, but they all serve a common goal: to
reduce medical errors to zero, thereby saving hundreds of thousands of lives
over the next decade and alleviating a substantial amount of misery through
the prevention of injury and adverse events.
The United States of America has the most expensive health care in the
world, but the results fare poorly when compared with other developed
nations. This results gap is sustained even when controlling for
socioeconomic status.5 In the quest to reduce the cost of health care, address
health care disparities, and improve patient safety, a broad range of
approaches have been pursued. This chapter will review some of the lessons
being applied to the medical field that have been drawn from other
disciplines, which must operate with a razor-thin margin of error, such as
the nuclear power and aviation industries. Tools to improve patient safety
that have been inspired from these industries and adapted for clinicians
include checklists, medical simulation, and crisis resource management
(CRM). Preflight checklists are standard procedure for airline pilots and are
integrated into the daily management of nuclear power plants. They are
increasingly being applied to the health care sector, from the OR to the
intensive care unit, to reduce the adverse events associated with high-risk
procedures. Flight simulators are also utilized in aviation to train new pilots,
assess experienced pilots, and train on new equipment. The principles of
crew resource management were first developed from an evaluation of
airline crashes that occurred in the 1970s. This technique involves raising
the situational awareness of all of the individuals who compose a team and
fostering a sense of ownership of the tasks at hand and developing clear and
effective communication.
This chapter will explore some of these tools and the way they are
currently impacting patient safety. It will examine how checklists have been
created to prevent the physician from making simple avoidable errors with
potential severe ramifications such as wrong side surgery. Simulation will
be explored as a platform for teaching patient safety, training teams, and
assessing performance. The principles of CRM will be described as an
approach to optimize team performance. In the final analysis, however, the
availability of useful and effective tools is of no benefit if they are not
utilized or are applied incorrectly. And while valuable lessons can be
garnered from other industries, in the field of medicine, the physicians and
other care providers do not go down with the ship; it is the patient and their
family who bears the risk associated with adverse events. Therefore, for
physicians and other health care providers, it is a moral imperative to
always incorporate tools that can improve patient safety at every level of
practice.
CHECKLISTS
The preflight checklist has long been the standard before any pilot takes off
in any aircraft from a single-engine craft as simple as a Piper Cub all the
way up to the B-2 Stealth Bomber. Despite the rapid adoption of checklists
in other industries, medicine has been resistant to the routine use of
checklists to avoid common errors. A major impetus was the publication of
Gawande's The Checklist Manifesto in 2009, which made the New York
Times Best Seller list and led to a public outcry for the medical field to
adopt checklists.6 A convergence of public and institutional awareness of
the problems of patient safety and the availability of tools such as checklists
that can improve safety has led to a steady increase in the integration of
checklists for processes ranging from simple procedures to the complex
management of medical crises. A 2013 expert consensus of patient safety
strategies strongly encouraged checklists as patient safety strategies ready
for immediate adoption by clinicians.7 In particular, these were
perioperative and anesthesia checklists to reduce perioperative events and
checklists to reduce central line–associated bloodstream infections.
Checklists have been utilized for central line placement to assure that
all line placements followed standard recommendations from the Center for
Disease Control. In a study at Johns Hopkins, the bedside nurse completed
a five-question checklist (Fig. 18-1), which recorded if the person placing
the line followed evidence-based practice for sterile placement of central
lines.8 Prior to the introduction of the checklists, their data demonstrated a
62% compliance with infection control guidelines. Following the
intervention, there was a reduction in the central line infection rate from
11.3/1000 catheter days to zero during the study period. Checklists have
also been shown to improve patient outcome in situations more complex
than simple procedures. A study involving eight hospitals in eight countries
conducted by the Safe Surgery Saves Lives Study Group demonstrates the
impact of a Surgical Safety Checklist (Table 18-1) on patient safety in
surgery. Between October 2007 and September 2008, there was a reduction
in perioperative death rate from 1.5% to 0.8% as well as a reduction in
inpatient complications from 11% to 7%.9

mortality in a global population. N Engl J Med. 2009;360:491–9.
Beyond preplanning for surgical cases, checklists improve patient outcomes
when implemented to handle crises in the OR. In a 2011 pilot study,
Ziewacz et al. showed a sixfold reduction in failure to adhere to critical
steps in the management of a variety of simulated rare surgical situations.
Failure to adhere to the critical steps was 24% without and 4% with the
checklist. An example of the cases used and checklist are shown in Figure
18-2.10 Expansion of this pilot study by Arriaga et al. in 2013 demonstrated
a similar reduction in failures to comply with critical steps from 23%
without the use of checklists to 6% when checklists were used.11

(From: Ziewacz JE, Arriaga AF, Bader AM, et al. Crisis checklists for the operating room:
development and pilot testing. J Am Coll Surg. 2011;213:212–9.)
Since clear reductions in morbidity and mortality have been demonstrated,
it is imperative to implement checklists into daily practice. The use of
checklists has minimal costs to hospitals such as for the initial training and
a small amount of time before, during, and after each situation in which the
checklist is used. These costs in dollars and time are easily made up for by
the decrease in medical errors, which result in longer and increasingly
unreimbursed hospital stays and increased demands on health care worker's
time. Such demands are not insignificant, as “checklist fatigue” can result in
nonapplication of this simple and effective method. In the perioperative
arena, nurses, surgeons, and anesthesiologists can all agree that checklists
reduce human error and improve human safety but admit that it is not used
for every procedure in every OR.12
SIMULATION
Simulation is an educational approach that provides an opportunity to learn
and practice complex medical care without putting any patients at risk.
There are numerous tools and techniques utilized in the realm of simulation
including 
task 
trainers, 
standardized 
patients, 
computer-controlled
mannequins, and computer programs. This approach can be varied
depending on the state of the learner, the provider's experience, and the
clinical situations encountered. Simulation can focus on team training,
CRM, and the education and assessment of individuals and teams.
A simulation can expose new learners to basic knowledge such as using
good hand washing techniques and calling for help in emergencies. Patient
safety concepts can be integrated throughout all levels of the simulation
education. For example, early learners can be trained to introduce
themselves upon meeting patients. These concepts can be reinforced during
the training of more experienced providers as new layers are integrated into
the training. Basic components of medical care can be approached through
simulation including bag mask ventilation, basic life support, and patient
interview practice. As students progress through their studies, simulation
can focus on more advanced techniques such as effective cardiopulmonary
resuscitation, advanced airway management, and effective communication
techniques.
In a recent expert consensus, simulation exercise and team training have
been encouraged as patient safety strategies ready for immediate adoption.7
Simulation has been used to enhance team training in emergency
department settings13 and has been used to evaluate anesthesiologists'
nontechnical skills (ANTS) of task management, teamwork, situational
awareness, and decision making.14 It has been used to evaluate latent safety
threats to patients from new teams working in new health care facilities and
in neonatal intensive care units.15,16 Such work allows the identification and
correction of these latent threats before patient exposure. Simulation has
also been used to demonstrate the efficacy of checklists and performance
improvement during simulated crisis.11
CRISIS 
RESOURCE
MANAGEMENT
The roots of simulation, like checklists, did not start in medicine but rather
grew from the aviation industry with the discovery that the majority of
aircraft mishaps were not due to equipment failure or lack of experience but
rather to the inability of the crew to harness their resources when needed at
a critical moment. From this awareness, the aviation simulation model of
Crew Resource Management grew in the 1980s as a joint venture between
the private airline industry, NASA, and the US military.17 This has since
been adopted by medicine as CRM. Like aviation, medicine offers a
dynamic environment where multiple problems can occur spontaneously or
compound each other. Medicine shares another commonality with aviation
in that groups of individuals (crews) often work together toward common
goals. The decision-making process and behaviors are often the same
whether the team consists of health care providers focusing on a
decompensating patient or pilots struggling to avert a crashing plane.
In CRM, each discipline in health care is considered a crew. Teams are
comprised of crews working together. Therefore, an OR case may consist of
individual crews of surgeons, an anesthesiologist, OR nurses, and a surgical
technician. The entire collection of crews is the assembled team taking on
the presented case. While a large percentage of simulation education
involves training individuals or groups from the same “crew,” the crux of
CRM involves integrating the crews into teams. Integration of the team
allows the individuals of a crew and the crews themselves to not only
practice their specific skills and contributions to the case but more
importantly allows the crews to develop the critical components of
teamwork and communication necessary to achieve a good patient outcome.
Another side benefit is that individuals from one crew often learn to
appreciate the skills and knowledge that another crew's members bring to
the health care team.
The key principles of CRM as established by Gaba18 and Salas and
modified by Carne19 are:
Know your environment.
Anticipate leadership and role clarity.
Communicate effectively.
Call for help early.
Allocate attention wisely—avoid fixation.
Distribute the workload—monitor and support team members.
Typically, CRM consists of three main components: didactics, simulation
scenarios, and debriefing. The didactic portion is frequently the first
component of CRM education but can also be inserted between simulation
sessions as a component of the debriefing. When done ahead of time, the
didactic component should be reasonably concise with small digestible
amounts of information. This information is then immediately put to work
in the simulation sessions where the team begins to integrate the new
information into their simulated practice. The final and often most
overlooked portion of CRM simulation is the debriefing. Typically done in
between simulation scenarios and often involving video and audio
recordings, the debriefing allows team members to see what was done well
and what could use improvement in any given scenario. Digital recordings
are an invaluable tool in these scenarios as they leave little room for
disagreement when things go poorly while allowing the entire team to
witness actions done well. To get the most out of simulation, allow for 2–3
minutes of debriefing time for every minute of simulation time. During
CRM debriefing, keep in mind that the emphasis is not on the individual
cognitive tasks or skills but instead on the management behaviors critical to
CRM. It is the teamwork and crew interactions that must be most closely
monitored and critiqued.
Finally, it must be asked, “Does CRM simulation training make a
difference in patient outcomes?” This is difficult to answer as the situations
where CRM is most meaningful are often low-occurrence high-acuity
situations. These events by their very nature make it difficult to accumulate
enough real-world cases to appropriately power a study demonstrating a
clinical benefit. Dozens of studies have shown that based on survey data
from simulated settings, learners feel much more comfortable after CRM
training. There are also multiple studies demonstrating improved teamwork
characteristics after CRM sessions. While these measures take place in the
simulated world, data suggest that we practice like we play so should expect
similar results in the real world.
The AHRQ has developed the TeamSTEPPS (Strategies and Tools to
Enhance Performance and Patient Safety) course as a teamwork training
system for advancing patient safety in organizations. The goal of
TeamSTEPPS is to produce highly effective teams that effectively utilize
available resources, information, and team members to produce optimal
patient outcomes. It is evidence based and created in collaboration between
AHRQ and the Department of Defense.
CONCLUSION
Medicine has advanced more in the past 150 years than it had in the
previous 2 millennia. Great advancements, however, have created greater
challenges in identifying and managing events that result in patient injury
and death. Estimates of a million injuries and 100,000 annual deaths from
adverse events make medical errors the sixth leading cause of death in the
US. Recent data suggest that these numbers have not decreased
substantially in the last decade.20 Numerous tools and techniques have been
developed in response to increasing focus from a growing number of
stakeholders. These include checklists, time outs, team training, and
simulation-based education and assessment. Checklists have demonstrated a
reduction of morbidity and mortality when utilized for central line
placement as well as for preoperative surgical preparation.21 Despite the
supportive evidence for using checklists to optimize patient safety, there is
evidence that checklists are not uniformly used and “never events” continue
to occur.22 Examples of sentinel events that should never occur include
wrong-sided 
surgery, 
retained 
objects 
following 
procedures, 
and
discharging an infant to the wrong family. Unfortunately, these events
continue to occur. Of the 6994 sentinel events reported from 2004 to 2012,
there were 928 wrong-patient, wrong-site, or wrong procedures performed,
773 events with an unintended retention of a foreign body, and 3 infants
discharged home to the wrong family.23 These events do not represent an
historical phenomenon that is gradually disappearing. Of the 928 wrong-site
procedures, 93 happened in 2010, 152 in 2011, and 109 in 2012. A similar
pattern occurs for all reported sentinel events and suggests that patient
safety is a major public health problem that is only beginning to be
addressed. An analysis of 9744 surgical never events from 1990 to 2010
demonstrated a 6.6% mortality permanent injury in 33% and temporary
injury in 59% of the patients. The costs of medical malpractice claims for
surgical never events during this period were estimated to be over $1.3
billion dollars.24 These events are preventable and would be prevented if
practitioners followed existing recommendations for care during procedures
including utilizing checklists, providing leadership to protect patients, and
assuring effective communication. Medicine has had a weak tradition of
focusing on patient safety. Future physicians and health care providers will
need to balance increasingly limited resources with the imperative to
optimize patient safety. Effective evidence-based tools must be utilized to
achieve these goals and to live up to the intent of nonmaleficence enshrined
by the Hippocratic Oath: Primum non nocere, First Do No Harm.
KEY POINTS
Numerous tools are available to address the ubiquitous problem
of patient safety including checklists, simulation, and team
training. These tools are uniformly useless if not utilized.
Checklists have been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality.
Properly performed time outs prior to procedures reduce medical
errors.
Simulation is an educational method of reflection, repetition, and
movement toward mastery.
Simulation provides an arena for practice without exposing
patients to the risk of injury.
CRM training strives to create teams, which use all available
resources with situational awareness, adaptability, leadership, and
effective communication.
TeamSTEPPS is a team training system intended to develop
highly functioning teams producing optimal patient outcomes.

CLINICAL VIGNETTE
Ms. G is a 34-year-old woman with a 4-year history of progressive thoracic
back pain with associated right leg numbness and weakness. Her past
medical history is significant for a history of bipolar disorder. She has a
reputation for poor compliance with her medical care. She is currently
being treated for type II diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.
Workup of her spinal complaints reveals a large thoracic disc herniation
with spinal cord compression. Ms. G has a 10th grade education and relies
on her family to help make decisions. She is anxious about having surgery
but is also quite concerned about the weakness in her right leg and her
difficulty walking. She frequently asks whether surgery is “necessary.”
What difficulties might there be in obtaining informed consent in this
case?
What are the essential steps in obtaining informed consent?
What other types of adverse events may occur during the perioperative
period?
INTRODUCTION
Over $400 billion are spent annually on surgical procedures in the US.1
These are performed in a variety of health care settings, ranging from
outpatient offices to tertiary care centers. More so than any other form of
medical intervention, surgical intervention represents a form of controlled
“harm” to the patient. This “harm” is meant to ultimately result in a desired
outcome for the patient. However, surgical interventions/procedures can
result in unintended complications that may not benefit the patient either in
the short or long term. It is fundamental to the physician–patient
relationship that patients are made aware of these risks, in order for the
patient to determine if they are willing to accept these risks in light of the
potential benefits. This chapter will cover some of the issues regarding the
process of educating patients or their representatives regarding the risks and
benefits associated with medical interventions in general, as well as
reviewing some of the more common perioperative complications,
including thromboembolic events, wrong-site surgery (WSS), and retained
foreign objects. Also, a brief discussion of processes that are being
developed to decrease the occurrence of these events will be included.
Currently reported rates of perioperative/periprocedural complications are
in the range 3–17% and are felt to be underreported.1 Clearly, there is a
significant “cost” in both harm to patients and resources to the health care
system associated with care provided in surgical and procedural areas. Both
patients and health care providers need to be aware of these costs and work
to contain them.
Informed Consent
It is rare for a patient not to have questions regarding the goals of a
particular treatment and potential consequences of this treatment. The
discussion of “risks and benefits” is a common interaction between health
care providers and patients. Most patients, however, have little information
upon which to base their decisions. Furthermore, the source of most of their
information is a member of the health care team providing the treatment,
resulting in inherent bias. The goal of pretreatment counseling is not only to
educate the patient about their treatment but also to obtain a patient's
permission for the treatment in question to be rendered. The extent to which
all potential complications or potential adverse events are discussed with a
patient may vary from case to case. The following is a brief introduction to
the history of informed consent and general guidelines to obtaining
informed consent under a variety of circumstances.
The concept of formal informed consent is a relatively recent one,
although there are abundant historical references to discussions between
physicians and patients regarding treatment. One such case involved the
battlefield care provided to General Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson. In 1863,
General Jackson sustained a severe injury to his left arm. There is
documentation of a face-to-face discussion between the general and his
surgeon, the intended procedure was discussed (amputation), and verbal
consent was obtained.2 No mention is made of potential complications
associated with the procedure. While, in fact, General Jackson survived the
procedure, he died of pneumonia 8 days later. The term “informed consent”
first entered the medical lexicon in the early 1960s during the malpractice
case Natanson v. Kline (1960).3 Ms. Natanson was referred to Dr. Kline for
radiation treatment for breast cancer. Radiation therapy was at that time in
its infancy, and the standards for effective treatment with minimal injury to
surrounding tissue were yet to be established. As a consequence of Dr.
Kline's treatment, Ms. Natanson went on to develop necrosis of her chest
wall adjacent to the site of treatment. Ms. Natanson alleged that Dr. Kline
did not inform her of this potential risk and had she known that significant
injury to her chest was a potential risk associated with the treatment, she
would not have consented to the procedure. After several appeals, the
Kansas State Supreme court issued the following ruling: “The duty of the
physician to disclose however is limited to those disclosures which a
reasonable medical professional would make under the same circumstances.
How the physician [executes his responsibility] to the patient…is a question
of medical judgment.” The definitions of a reasonable medical professional
and good judgment were left vague and have been the basis of litigation
since. The ruling, however, represents a major shift in the consent process.
Prior to this, legal matters regarding consent were focused mainly on a
patient's right to refuse treatment rather than their right to be informed
about their treatment (Schloendorff v. Society of New York Hospital,
1914).4
Components of Informed Consent
While there is no absolute standard for what constitutes informed consent,
some general principles are widely accepted. Among the most basic of these
standards, with the exception of emergency consent, is that a discussion of
the treatment goals and the potential for complications/adverse events must
occur. It must not be assumed that the patient understands a priori that there
are risks associated with treatment. Secondly, record must be made of this
discussion and entered into the medical record. To this end, most
practitioners have adopted the use of standardized forms to document this
discussion. Use of such standardized forms does not replace the
requirement for discussion with the patient prior to treatment. At a
minimum, this discussion should cover the following:
The patient's diagnosis and the anticipated course of the
disease/condition.
The nature of the proposed treatment or procedure.
The most commonly associated risks and benefits of the proposed
treatment or procedure.
Alternatives to the proposed procedure and their associated risk and
benefits, including the option of no further treatment.
The discussion should occur in lay language and the individual seeking
consent must verify that the patient understands the language being
used.
The person providing consent must be given the opportunity to ask
questions. The person obtaining consent must make the effort to
ascertain what is important for the person obtaining consent to
understand, as this will vary from person to person.
Who May Provide Informed Consent
Any adult of legal age and of sound mind may provide consent for
treatment. Patients who are obtunded, unconscious, encephalopathic,
psychotic, or otherwise impaired may not provide consent for treatment.
Unless the absence of treatment represents significant risk to the patient,
treatment cannot proceed until either a patient is able to provide consent or
an acceptable alternate can be found. The exact hierarchy of who may
provide consent for a patient unable to do so for himself varies from state to
state, but the following list is typical of the list used in many jurisdictions:
1. Legal power of attorney 2. Patient's spouse
3. Patient's adult child*
4. Patient's parent*
5. Patient's sibling*
6. Patient's adult grandchild or other adult relative*
7. Close friend of the patient*
8. Legal guardian of the patient's estate
*Agreement must be reached between members of equal priority
Special Considerations
Cognitively Impaired Patients
There is a spectrum of cognitive impairment. While some individuals with
mild cognitive impairment are unable to live independently, many patients
with mild cognitive impairment are capable of and should make decisions
with respect to their health care. It is important to establish whether a
patient makes these types of decisions independently or with the aid of a
guardian/legal power of attorney. When in doubt, it is best to solicit the aid
of available family members. Every effort should be made to include the
patient in discussions regarding their care to the extent that the patient is
able to participate.
Pediatric Patients
Patients old enough to express understanding and voice an opinion
pertaining to medical treatment must be included in the process for
obtaining informed consent. While, legally, informed consent is obtained
from a child's or youth's guardian, ethically, assent should be obtained from
the minor during the informed consent process. Lack of assent should
prompt delay of treatment for nonemergent procedures. Under certain
circumstances, minors can be treated as adults with respect to consent for
medical treatment. “Emancipated” minors represent a special class of
patient. The criteria defining an emancipated minor vary from state to state.
In general, minors living independently or with children of their own are
considered “emancipated.” In some states, minors, who would otherwise
rely on parents or guardians to provide consent in most matters, may
provide consent independent of their parents/guardians under certain
circumstances, particularly with respect to treatment for pregnancy and
sexually transmitted diseases.
Patients Whose Primary Language Is Not English
A licensed, approved medical interpreter should be involved whenever
attempting to obtain informed consent from a non-English–speaking
patient. Family members should not be used for this purpose under
nonemergent circumstances, unless the patient is unable to participate in the
consent process. In most hospitals, interpreter services are readily available
or can be contacted by telephone.
The Unconscious Patient
The groundwork for treating a patient unable to provide consent and for
whom no one is available to provide consent was established at the turn of
the 20th century. Mary Schloendorff consented to an exam under anesthesia
to determine if a fibroid tumor was malignant.4 She did not provide consent
for removal of the tumor. While under anesthesia, her surgeon determined
that the tumor was indeed malignant and removed the tumor. Ms.
Schloendorff proceeded to sue the hospital and not her surgeon. While the
case had a significant impact on the immunity of charitable organizations to
be sued for the actions of its employees, the case also had an impact on the
ability of physicians to use their judgment in the care of an unconsentable
patient. In Schloendorff v. Society of New York Hospital (1914), the court
ruled: “Every human being of adult years and sound mind has a right to
determine what shall be done with his own body…This is true except in
cases of emergency where the patient is unconscious and where it is
necessary to operate before consent can be obtained.” Emergent consent is
obtained by two physicians agreeing that a procedure is required to treat an
emergent condition for an unresponsive patient, when all reasonable
measures to contact next of kin have been exhausted. At that point, both
physicians sign the consent form, document necessity for the procedure and
what efforts were made to reach next of kin, and then proceed with surgical
intervention.
COMPLICATIONS 
FROM
INVASIVE PROCEDURES
The intention of the informed consent process is to inform patients and their
families of the reasonably expected risks and benefits associated with a
particular treatment. In most cases, it is impossible to predict which patients
will experience what complication. Certain complications, however, occur
frequently enough and are felt to have a significant enough impact on
patient outcome that they deserve special consideration and have come to
be referred to as “never events.” The intended consequence of this
designation is to provide patients with “safer” care and better outcomes.
The impact of these measures on patient outcomes remains to be
established.
The term “never events” has been used by the Center for Medicare and
Medicaid Services (CMS) to describe conditions for which reimbursement
of medical costs incurred as a consequence of these “never events” will be
withheld.5 The goal is to promote the delivery of “safer” care to patients by
incentivizing to hospitals to establish quality and safety programs (Table
19-1). A review of some of the most commonly encountered adverse events
follows.
TABLE 19-1 Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services 2013 List of
Non-reimbursable Serious Hospital-Acquired Conditions (HAC)5
Central 
Line–Associated 
Bloodstream
Infections
Placement of a central venous catheter (CVC) is one of the most commonly
performed invasive procedures. In the surgical patient, these catheters can
be 
used 
to 
monitor 
central 
venous 
pressure, 
administer
antibiotics/medications, provide a route for fluid resuscitation/transfusion,
provide nutritional support, and allow for blood draws. Because these
catheters are often in place for extended periods of time and frequently
accessed, they are at significant risk for infection. Infections associated with
CVCs have been estimated to result in excess of 2 billion dollars per year in
additional health care costs.6 The incidence for this type of infection is
often tracked as the incidence of infection over a certain number of line
days. Using this method of tracking, the incidence of catheter-related
bloodstream infections has been reported to range from 0.1 to 2.7/1000 line
days and is highly dependent on the type of catheter.7 Short-term central
venous catheters, such as those commonly used perioperatively, have the
highest rate of infection. The most common organisms involved are
staphylococci. Infection is felt to occur both due to extra- and intraluminal
migration of bacteria and yeast along the catheter. Tunneling of long-term
catheters decreases the risk of extraluminal spread. Treatment generally
consists of removal of the line and a course of intravenous (IV) antibiotics
but is dependent on the causative organism and the type of line affected.
Prevention remains the mainstay of treatment. Numerous studies have
demonstrated that strict adherence to standardized treatment protocols can
result in a significant decrease in the rate of CVC infections rates. These
protocols and care bundles provide both behavioral and treatment
guidelines.6 Please refer to Table 19-2 for a summary of these guidelines.8
See Chapter 9 for more information about central line–associated blood
stream infections.
TABLE 19-2 Recommended Practices for Prevention of Central Venous
Catheter–Related Bloodstream Infection8
Venous Thromboembolism
The incidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in critically ill patients is
quite high. Surgical intervention itself is felt to be an independent risk
factor for the development of DVT. Chemo- and mechanical prophylaxis
can substantially reduce DVT rates but does not eliminate the problem.
Approximately 1/3 of the nearly 200,000 deaths associated annually with
venous thromboembolism (VTE) occur in postoperative patients, and while
approximately 50% of trauma patient may be found to have DVT, it appears
that only 5% of trauma patients may develop symptomatic VTE.9–11 In both
cases, the use of mechanical and chemoprophylaxis has become the
standard of care. Some surgical and trauma patients despite being at high
risk for the development of DVT/VTE are also at high risk for the
development 
of 
hemorrhagic 
complications 
from 
pharmacologic
prophylaxis. The increased risk of hemorrhage for these patients while on
anticoagulation therapy varies in the literature and depends on the exact
nature of the injury and the method of treatment. Inferior Vena Cava (IVC)
filters are not currently recommended for primary VTE prevention in
general, abdominal-pelvic or trauma surgery patients.9 IVC filters may be
used for inpatients with VTE in whom anticoagulation therapy cannot be
started, must be stopped, or is insufficient to protect patients from a clinical
significant PE, but only provide protection from large thromboembolic
events and do not treat the underlying disease.12 Additionally, not all filters
are ultimately retrievable. An indwelling IVC filter commits patients to
lifelong anticoagulation therapy, if there are no contraindications to
anticoagulation, and the potential for filter thrombosis.12 Judicious use
should be made of IVC filters, particularly in young patients, nonterminally
ill patients, and patients at high risk for fall, as they may require lifelong
anticoagulation/antiplatelet therapy. Despite all of the above, early
mobilization and mechanical/pharmacologic prophylaxis are the standard of
care for surgical and trauma patients, and there is abundant support in the
literature that this standard has an impact upon the rate of DVT.9,13–15 For
more information about VTE prevention, see Chapter 8, Preventable Harm.
Falls
Up to 1 in 5 patients fall at least once during their hospital stay.16,17 These
falls lead to injuries, increased length of stay, and increased medical
expenditure. It has been argued extensively in the public arena as to
whether or not falls are preventable in the inpatient setting. The reactionary
response to the financial implications of an inpatient fall being considered a
nonreimbursable event frequently led providers to either chemically or
physically restrain a patient considered a “fall risk” but who would
otherwise not meet restraint criteria. This excessive use of both chemical
and physical restraints may themselves lead to untoward and unintended
consequences including higher thromboembolic complications due to
immobility and/or delayed recovery due to prolonged sedation as well as
functional loss, delirium, and pressure ulcers.16 A recent systematic review
identified that, at best, up to 20% of inpatient falls could be prevented.17
Unfortunately, no intervention has been shown to reduce the risk of serious
injury following an inpatient fall. For more information about fall
prevention, see Chapter 8, Preventable Harm.
Surgical Site Infections
Surgical site infections (SSIs) are the third most common nosocomial
infections, representing approximately 15% of all hospital-acquired
infections overall. In surgical patients, SSIs represent the most common
hospital-acquired infection at 38% of the total. Of these, 2/3 are defined as
superficial SSIs and 1/3 represent deep SSIs. SSIs are associated with
significant morbidity and mortality for patients who develop them. SSIs
extend hospital stays by up to a week after routine surgical procedures and
contribute to a significant increase in health care costs for patients.18 A
heightened awareness of postoperative wound infections and measures to
prevent them can have useful results including meticulous attention to
proper surgical technique and postoperative wound care, but overuse of
antibiotics may contribute to bacterial resistance and/or secondary
infections including Clostridium difficile colitis. Additionally, patient
comorbidities often contribute to complications with wound healing,
including diabetes and prior exposure to radiation therapy. To say that all
SSIs are preventable is unlikely, but strict adherence to best practices
should be the norm regardless of reimbursement. For more information
about Surgical site infections, see Chapter 9, Health Care-Associated
Infections.
Retained Sponges and Instruments
Various terms exist for the scenario when an object is left in the patient after
a surgical procedure, including retained foreign bodies, retained foreign
objects, retained surgical instruments, or, as used here, retained sponges and
instruments (RSI). No matter which term is used, however, all can agree
that whenever this situation occurs, there is resulting harm to patients, with
physical, emotional, social, and financial implications. In addition, surgeons
can be held legally responsible for its occurrence, even in the face of the
nursing staff admitting liability.19 Beginning in 2002, the National Quality
Forum (NQF), a nonprofit organization tasked with the improvement of
health care quality measurement and reporting, released a list of serious
reportable events (SREs). The “unintended retention of a foreign object in a
patient after surgery or other invasive procedure,” or RSI, is one of these
events.20 In addition, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have
decided since 2007 to not reimburse for any part of the surgical procedure
in the case of RSI. Despite multiple studies and interventions put into place
to reduce the incidence of RSI, such as counting of sponges and
instruments, for example, these “never events” continue to occur.
The incidence of RSI has been estimated to range from 1 in 5500 to 1 in
18,760 inpatient operations per year.21–23 In a landmark study by Gawande
et al. of 54 patients with RSI, 37 (69%) required reoperation, and 1 died
(2%). The most common risk factors for the occurrence of RSI included
emergent surgery, unexpected change in the surgical procedure, and high
body mass index (BMI). The time course for the detection of RSI was
highly variable, with a range from postoperative day 0 to over 6 years after
the procedure, and the median time of detection was postoperative day 21.22
Lincourt et al. replicated this study, examining cases of RSI from 1996
through 2005 at a large academic medical center.24 Over this time period,
37 cases of RSI occurred, with 25 patients (83%) requiring reoperation.
This study found additional risk factors for RSI, including the reporting of
an incorrect count and the total number of major procedures. A similar
study by Cima et al. of 34 cases of RSI from 2003 to 2006 at a large
academic medical center largely replicated these findings; however, in this
study, none of the cases of RSI resulted from emergent cases, multiple
surgical teams, or late procedures.23 Tables 19-3 and 19-4 summarize the
characteristics and risk factors for RSI after a surgical procedure.
TABLE 19-3 Characteristics of Cases of RSI after a Surgical Procedure
NR, not reported.
TABLE 19-4 Risk Factors for RSI after a Surgical Procedure
NR, not reported.
A large review of over 9000 malpractice claims filed in Massachusetts
during the years 1988–1994 revealed that the most common procedures
resulting in RSI were procedures with an open body cavity, with 40 cases of
RSI total. Together, obstetrics/gynecology procedures (23 out of 40 cases)
and general surgery (12 out of 40 cases) accounted for over 80% of the
claims, with two laminectomies, a Caldwell-Luc (sinus surgery), and two
coronary artery bypass grafts comprising the remaining claims.19 Other
studies have reported consistent findings, with the most common locations
for RSI including the abdomen or pelvis (47–54%), thorax (7.4–23%), or
vagina (22%).22,24
The surgical count is a widely used method of screening for RSI. The
protocol standardized by the Association of Perioperative Registered Nurses
(AORN) involves an initial count (before the procedure), interim counts
(throughout the procedure), the closing count (at the end of the procedure
before the skin is closed), and the reconciliation count (after all instruments
have been removed from the field and the surgical site is closed). These are
performed by the circulating nurse and surgical technologist, and any
discrepancies in the count are communicated to the surgeon.25
In a study of counts during elective general surgery cases, the authors
found that on average about 17 counts occurred per case, and discrepancies
in the count occurred once per eight cases, or once per 14 hours of operative
time. When a discrepancy occurred, the most common reason was due to a
misplaced object (59%), meaning the item was unintentionally lost, ending
up anywhere from in the trash to inside the patient (however, no RSI was
detected during this study). A documentation error was the next most
common reason (38%), and a pure miscount was rare (3%). A change in
either the circulating nurse or the surgical technologist during the procedure
resulted in a threefold higher risk of a discrepancy.26
Because the surgical count is subject to human error and thus is an
imperfect process, some have questioned its efficacy. One should note that
in patients with RSI, the count was documented as correct 88% of the time,
which was not statistically significantly different from study controls with
no RSI (92%).22 In a study of coronary bypass surgeries in New York State,
Egorova et al. showed that the specificity of a normal count in the detection
of RSI was 99.3%, with a negative predictive value of approximately 100%.
In contrast, the sensitivity of a discrepancy in the count was 77%, with a
positive predictive value of 1.6%.21
Additional measures such as sponge counters, bar-coding sponges,
radiofrequency (RF) identification technology, and x-ray or CT screening
have been proposed to minimize the incidence of RSI. While low-cost
measures such as sponge counters (bags to hold sponges) have been widely
adopted but not rigorously studied, other methods have been shown to be
useful in the published literature. A randomized, controlled trial comparing
a traditional counting protocol to bar-coded sponge counting found that
while the use of bar-coded sponges led to increased counting time (9
minutes vs. 12 minutes per case), their use also led to an increase in the
detection of a discrepant count.27
RF technology has shown excellent diagnostic accuracy in cadaver28,29
and preliminary human studies,30 with a detection rate of 100%. However,
before wide adoption of RF sponges, cost-effectiveness analyses in addition
to randomized, controlled trials are needed to justify the increased cost.
Even with preliminary data showing excellent results, it is still possible to
miss retained sponges by scanning incorrectly or scanning too early before
all sponges have been used.29 In addition, the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) has pointed out the potential risk for RF technology
interfering with other electronic medical devices, such as pacemakers and
implantable cardioverter–defibrillators (ICDs).31
The use of routine postoperative x-rays, although expensive, was shown
to have found 59% of RSI detected, all in patients with a correctly reported
count. Unfortunately, x-ray imaging alone is not sufficient to capture all
cases of RSI, as the foreign body was not detected in 6 out of 18 patients in
this same study. Reasons that x-ray imaging may not be successful, as
suggested by the authors, included poor image quality, multiple foreign
objects in the field, and failure to communicate the reason for obtaining the
image to the radiologist.23 In addition, there is evidence that performing
routine intraoperative x-rays would not be cost-effective. One cost-effective
study showed that even if we assume that x-rays have 100% sensitivity for
the detection of sponges, the cost of preventing one retained surgical sponge
would be >$1.3 million per sponge.32
Although the occurrence of RSI is uncommon, it can have a devastating
impact on the patient and health care provider alike. New methods are
currently under development to serve as an adjunct to the surgical count,
but no method has yet proven to be without its disadvantages. Making RSI
truly a “never event” while operating under a realistic budget may prove to
be a formidable challenge. In spite of its faults, it is important to take the
surgical count seriously and not allow one's ego to stand in the way of
providing safe surgery.
Wrong-Site Surgery, Time Outs, and
Checklists
Wrong-site surgery (WSS) deeply resonates with patients, the public, the
media, and other health care providers as an adverse event for which there
is simply no excuse. These events have been written about in the lay press
in addition to top medical journals. Surgery performed on the wrong body
part, surgery performed on the wrong patient, and wrong surgical procedure
performed on a patient are all surgical never events as defined by the NQF.
These types of events are typically categorized together as wrong-site
surgeries since they share common root causes and prevention
interventions.
Although the true incidence of WSS is difficult to measure, these
adverse events accounted for 13% (928/6994) of reported sentinel events to
the Joint Commission from 2004 to 2012.33 In 2011, Kaiser Health News
reported that the Joint Commission officials estimated that WSS occurs 40
times each week in US hospitals and clinics.34 Studies using data from
malpractice insurers and surveys show wide variations in the estimated
incidence, particularly between spine surgeries and other sites.35–39 Even
though there have been several interventions and initiatives to prevent
WSS, the incidence seems to be increasing. It is unclear if this is related to a
true increase or improved event reporting.33
There are several factors that contribute to WSS events. These factors
can be categorized into human factors, patient factors, procedure factors,
and system factors.40 Once the decision is made to perform an operation,
the complexities of the process to get that patient into the operating room
and start surgery provide several layers at risk for errors to be made that
could lead to a WSS.41 The Joint Commission Center for Transforming
Healthcare identified 29 main causes of WSS throughout the preoperative
surgical continuum, which included scheduling (n = 4), pre-op holding (n =
12), operating room (n = 8), and organization culture (n = 5).42 The Joint
Commission additionally reported in 2012 that of 879 cases of WSS, the 3
most common root causes were related to leadership, communication, and
human factors.43
In 2003, the Joint Commission introduced Universal Protocol (UP) for
prevention of WSS. UP included a briefing (occurs immediately upon
patient arrival into the operating room) and time out (occurs after the
patient is prepped and draped and prior to incision), which emphasized
preoperative 
verifications, 
site 
marking, 
and 
other 
standardized
confirmations.44 Shortly after being introduced, UP was mandated by the
Joint Commission for hospital accreditation. The next major effort to
prevent WSS was the Safe Surgery Saves Lives Initiative from the World
Health Organization (WHO), which aimed to reduce the number of
surgical-related deaths and complications worldwide. It is important to
understand that this effort did not intend to just decrease the incidence of
WSS, but all surgical-related deaths and complications. A Surgical Safety
Checklist was created by multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary groups
with the hypothesis that improved team communication and consistency of
care would reduce complications and deaths related to surgery.45 After
being studied in a wide range of hospital practice environments worldwide,
use of the WHO Surgical Safety Checklist significantly decreased deaths,
SSIs, unplanned reoperations, and complications.46 These data also
translated favorably to urgent operations.47 This effort has now been
expanded to surgical crisis checklists and customized checklists that are
procedure specific.48,49 Other surgical checklists have also been well tested,
including 
the 
Surgical 
Patient 
Safety 
System 
(SURPASS), 
a
multidisciplinary checklist that follows the surgical pathway from
admission to discharge.50
The data regarding whether UP and checklist interventions have
decreased the incidence of WSS are equivocal.36,51–54 Simply introducing a
surgical checklist will not necessarily make an impact unless there is
training, teamwork, and engagement of the involved health care
providers.55 As stated by Dr. Martin Makary “The moral hazard of the
Universal Protocol is that we rely on it in place of ourselves. Although I
agree that Universal Protocol compliance is important, it is not the magic
wand of Merlin.”56

With the exception of emergency consent, informed consent must
include a discussion of treatment goals along with the potential
for adverse events to occur. There are special considerations for
obtaining informed consent for cognitively impaired patients,
pediatric patients, patients whose primary language is not
English, and unconscious patients.
Surgical “never events” are defined by the NQF and include
errors in surgical care, which are identifiable, are preventable, and
have serious consequences to patients.
Adherence to best practices can minimize the occurrence of
several serious complications from invasive procedures.
The occurrence of RSI is uncommon, but it can have a
devastating impact on the patient and health care provider.
Several risk factors have been identified for RSI. New methods
are currently under development to serve as an adjunct to the
surgical count.
There have been significant efforts to decrease the incidence of
WSS. Causes for WSS are multifactorial and related to the
continuum of the perioperative process rather than just what
happens in the operating room. Regular use of surgical safety
checklists will hopefully decrease the incidence of WSS and other
surgical complications.

CLINICAL VIGNETTE
Ms. C was a 22-year-old woman who was pregnant for the first time.
At 38 weeks, 2 days gestation (determined by first trimester
ultrasound), she was admitted for induction of labor for severe pre-
eclampsia. At admission, Leopold measurements revealed an estimated
fetal weight of 3900 g. Ms. C's pregnancy was only complicated by
anemia (iron deficiency and sickle cell trait). She was induced with
misoprostol and augmented with oxytocin. She progressed to complete
cervical dilation. At time of delivery, the neonate was noted to show
the “turtle sign,” in which the neonate's head appeared retracted. The
neonate subsequently had shoulder dystocia that lasted for 1.5 minutes
and was relieved by the McRoberts maneuver, suprapubic pressure,
and, ultimately, the Woods maneuver. Ms. C had a second-degree
laceration that was repaired in layers, with the use of local anesthesia.
She had an estimated blood loss of 400 mL.
The newborn's actual weight was 3245 g, and his Apgar scores at 1 and
5 minutes were 7 and 8, respectively. The newborn's cord gases were
as follows: pH 7.2, pCO2 63 mm Hg, HCO3 22 mEq/L, and base
deficit 5.5 mEq/L. The shoulder dystocia was diagnosed as left
shoulder anterior. The pediatric team also noted that the newborn had
an asymmetric Moro reflex (right < left) at the time of delivery. This
finding suggests that a brachial plexus injury occurred. The events
were disclosed to Ms. C, and a disclosure note was written and placed
in the chart.
Ms. C's systolic blood pressure (BP) was 130–140 off magnesium
prophylaxis, and she was discharged home on postpartum day (PPD)
#2 with no additional BP medication and a follow-up appointment in
4–6 weeks.
Ms. C presented to the Pregnancy Assessment Center (PAC) on PPD#5
after her BP at home was 180/90. She had severe range BPs initially in
PAC, but no neurologic symptoms and normal labs, and her BPs
became normal to mild, so magnesium was not initiated. Ms. C was
given nifedipine XL 30 mg to achieve BP control. She stayed
overnight to ensure good BP control and was discharged on PPD#6.
Could anything have been done prenatally to prevent the
elevation in Ms. C's BP that led to her induction of labor?
Could anything have been done immediately postpartum to
prevent the readmission?
INTRODUCTION
Patient safety/quality improvement (PS/QI) in obstetrics is unique in that it
not only involves the care of the pregnant mother but also must consider the
safety and well-being of the fetus. The management of one patient directly
affects the outcome of the other. Numerous programs have been established
over the years to improve the teamwork and collaboration of all members of
the care team in labor and delivery, including the obstetricians,
neonatologists, anesthesiologists, and nurses.1
The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) has been
committed to PS and quality throughout the care continuum. Although
inpatient issues initially took first priority in PS efforts nationwide,
ambulatory PS has been given its own set of standards. In 2003, ACOG
developed a set of principles and objectives that they ask all obstetrician–
gynecologists to adopt in their clinical practice or hospital.
The objectives are to:
encourage a culture of PS
implement recommended safe medication practices
reduce the likelihood of surgical errors
improve communication with health care providers
improve communication with patients
establish a partnership with patients to improve safety
make safety a priority in every aspect of practice2
Adverse Outcomes in Obstetrics and
Gynecology
According to ACOG, the rate of pre-eclampsia in the US has increased 25%
in the last two decades, and this hypertensive disorder is the leading cause
of maternal mortality in the US and worldwide. The 2011 Child Health
USA reported that the rate of maternal death related to eclampsia and pre-
eclampsia was 1.5/100,000 live births, and the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC) reported that 9.9% of all pregnancy-related deaths in
the US from 2006 to 2009 were due to eclampsia and pre-eclampsia. There
is no clear-cut way to identify those women with pre-eclampsia who are at
increased risk for adverse outcomes. Safe delivery and management of the
mother and baby with pre-eclampsia depend on the appropriate
management of the systolic and diastolic BPs during the prenatal,
intrapartum, and postpartum periods. This involves close surveillance at
each prenatal visit and aggressive treatment of the hypertension as soon as
it arises. The only “cure” that exists for pre-eclampsia is delivery of the
baby once all the risks to the mom and the baby have been considered.3
Review of the Current State/Inventory
A current state inventory is the only way to evaluate how an obstetric
service is doing in terms of preventable harm, safety, and quality. This will
allow the service to identify steps the PS/QI program can take to improve.
The following information on outcomes of interest should be collected and
evaluated: information on patient complaints, claims, serious/sentinel
events, peer-review referrals from hospitals or other departments, infection
control data, morbidity and mortality (M&M) cases, and quality
assurance/QI criteria.
The obstetric service should next assess which of the following
recommended activities are already in place:
Peer-review committee to select M&M cases
Analysis of events according to PS/QI criteria or trigger tools
Event reporting system
Medication error reporting
Infection surveillance
Ongoing efforts to promote a culture of PS and transparency
Collection of staff perceptions of, and suggestions for improving, PS
Determination of staff willingness to report errors
The department can begin its analysis of events with their PS officer and
should always cooperate with and participate in any hospital event analysis
processes such as debriefings and root cause analysis. By looking into how
adverse events are reported and investigated, as well as into the details of
the discussion, it will often be possible to find suggestions for
improvements that can be extended to providers. These suggestions can
only add to the understanding of the existing environment and inform the
department about interventions and processes most likely to be successful
(Fig. 20-1).
Figure 20-1 WUSM Department of OB/GYN improvement process
diagram.
PS/QI Infrastructure
After determining the priorities and identifying strategies are already being
implemented in the department, the challenges are to provide an
infrastructure to support the collection and analysis of events and outcomes
and to assure that learning points or remediation will follow from that
analysis. As in any successful organization, leadership is key to setting the
tone, culture, and overall PS environment for success.
Patient Safety Team
ACOG suggests that the team should include representation from each
service that is affected. This guideline ensures that all important
stakeholders are involved in the process of identification, discussion, and
possible action for process improvement. For example, such a team would
include 
an 
obstetrician, 
obstetrician 
anesthesiologist,
neonatologist/pediatrician, and obstetric and pediatric nurses. Each of these
representatives should have some component of leadership and technical
expertise and should be involved in the day-to-day process of the clinical
unit.4
Patient Safety Officer
Department leadership must identify one or two key individuals as the
PS/QI team leader(s). These key staff should have special training in PS to
guide the discussion of events from a mere anecdotal/reactive approach to a
more global view of processes and systems. This person must be capable of
doing and saying the challenging things when necessary but also of
encouraging an informal way for staff to communicate concerns, problems,
or errors. These individuals will hold respect within the department on a
clinical and academic level as well as among peers outside of the
department. The staff/individuals must be credible and nonjudgmental, and
they should be comfortable asking questions in a nonaccusatory manner.4
The PS officer will be the starting point for the PS/QI team that will form
within the department and thus must be able to manage all the resources of
the team involved, encourage team behavior, and sometimes help resolve
team conflicts. He or she speaks for the group that is analyzing each case as
well as for the department. This person will lay the groundwork for ongoing
discussions on any given topic or case and set the tone for the initial
discussion, analysis, and ongoing conversations that will result from
identification of cases. The department leadership must support this role
and be committed to fostering a safe environment in which all feel free to
openly discuss adverse events, errors, and outcomes. Clear leadership has
been shown to improve PS that benefits providers, staff, the medical
institution, and, most importantly, the patient.4
Patient Safety Coordinator
Accountability is a vital piece of the PS/QI infrastructure. This includes
accountability to the providers of the care, the staff that participated in the
care, and the patient herself. Many safety or quality teams may include a PS
coordinator to help ensure accountability. This person is a caregiver with
either a clinical background or PS background who participates in the case
discussion and keeps each member of the committee/team on task to ensure
that identified process improvements are made. This person's primary role
is to aid in the identification and implementation of interventions to
decrease medical errors and enhance PS through systematic care process
and outcome evaluation in the Department of OB/GYN. The PS coordinator
works to encourage transparency and reporting, identifies opportunities for
process improvement, acts as a liaison with hospital partners and other
hospital departments, develops standards, and assesses ongoing reliability
of changes made. In addition, the PS coordinator assists OB/GYN
researchers in the collection and use of PS data for research purposes.
Steps to Improve PS/QI
The important steps are to determine how to identify cases of adverse
events, report and discuss these cases, identify any action to take,
disseminate the feedback, and, finally, educate the care providers to
diminish the chance of future similar events. While there are many possible
approaches to improving the safety and quality of care, we will describe
some of the approaches used at the Washington University School of
Medicine in St. Louis (WUSM).
Identify cases
One simple way to identify cases in which PS/QI was inadequate would be
to use the already established ACOG clinical indicators.4 Though not all-
inclusive, these indicators include both maternal and neonatal criteria and
can be adapted to fit any particular OB setting. Department leadership and
the PS/QI team need to encourage ongoing reporting of cases that meet
agreed-upon ACOG PS and quality criteria. This can be through the chief
resident managing labor and delivery in an academic setting, through the PS
coordinator, or through the team leader. Figure 20-2 lists triggers for case
review in obstetrics utilized at the Washington University School of
Medicine in St. Louis (WUSM).
Figure 20-2 Triggers for review.
 
Report and discuss cases
As part of establishing criteria for reporting, attention must be paid to
creating a culture that supports reporting. Cases may be reported by
attendings, residents, nursing staff, and, sometimes, managers. At many
hospitals, residents, faculty, and staff can report any case voluntarily
through online Event Reporting Systems (ERS). The ERS is kept
confidential and reviewed within the department. The case may be brought
to the team members for discussion. Input can also be from hospital
partners and other hospital departments. Should the hospital or other
department see a PS or process issue, it may be brought to the attention of
the PS/QI team within the department. Transparency and reporting should
be encouraged to identify opportunities to improve processes and
communication with other hospital partners and departments.
If a case meets the agreed-upon criteria, then the identified QI
leadership or the department leadership will determine the venue in which it
will be discussed. Options include M&M, section/divisional meetings, and
root cause analysis meetings. Some groups establish a multidisciplinary
committee to conduct a weekly case review. This includes input and
discussion from maternal–fetal medicine attendings, OB attendings,
neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) attendings, OB anesthesiology
attendings, PS, and nursing leadership.
The PS/QI team provides ongoing support and encouragement for
disclosure and increased transparency. Joint Commission requires that
patients be made aware of any unanticipated adverse event that may have
taken place while they are under the care of an MD.5 Thus, MDs have an
ethical obligation to communicate in an open and honest way. Studies have
shown that when something unexpected happens, patients expect and want
to know about it, and they want someone to take responsibility for what
happened to them. Much support is available for MDs to seek help in
communication of adverse events. Disclosure will only help to increase the
transparency of a department and encourage ongoing PS/QI.
Identify actions to take
During case review, all involved are able to make suggestions to improve
PS. This review focuses on the department rather than the individual.
Although the feedback might be directed to an individual, all are able to
learn what might be done differently the next time.
Often, there will be a need to refer a case review to other areas. This
can mean referring to another division within our own department, another
department that may have participated in the care of the patient, or even to
our hospital partners. Each referral that is sent is meant to encourage
ongoing teamwork with all those involved in the care of the patient and to
increase the transparency across the organization. Referrals are meant to be
nonaccusatory, instead helping to bridge a connection between departments
across the care continuum. Referrals are sent with the expectation of
ongoing dialogue and conversation between all those involved. Oftentimes,
the response that is received will require further information/clarification or
lead to additional problem solving.
Disseminate feedback
Most health care errors occur as a result of a system, not just one
individual.6 Thus, outputs from case review and discussion need to be clear
and concise to encourage ongoing, uninhibited, and unobstructed reporting
as well as education and process improvement. Several approaches may be
used to ensure that those who actually participate in the day-to-day care of
the patients on the inpatient unit learn the information covered in the case
review sessions.
Patient Safety Alerts
Patient safety alerts send information to all residents, attendings, and
nursing staff. These alerts, delivered via e-mail, are simple, short, and not
provider-specific. They convey a simple message such as a reminder about
an existing protocol or a clinical technique. In this way, all can learn from
the case.
Direct Communication to the MD Involved in
the Care of a Particular Patient
Direct communication to the MD involved in the care of a particular patient
should come directly from the MD responsible for being the team leader.
This communication should be nonconfrontational, not accusatory, and
meant to serve as a teaching point going forward. If the team leader thinks
there is an issue with an individual MD, it should be referred directly to the
chairman.
Educational 
Lectures 
or 
Continuing
Education Conferences
Educational lectures or continuing education conferences are good ways to
disseminate information to caretakers. For example, if a new process is
being implemented for triage of patients in the emergency department, all
attendings, residents, and nursing staff in each department will need to
know about it. This may require more than one occasion for education and
include more than one department. For instance, a presentation can be made
at departmental grand rounds or at resident teaching conference.
Importantly, information must be conveyed consistently to as many
caregivers as possible. The education is meant to focus on the process
change and implementation and to allow those that will be working the
process to have a voice in the implementation; this may happen with just
one encounter or may need ongoing feedback for success. The challenge
continues to be how information that is presented at a certain time and place
is passed along to those residents who are working through the levels.
Ongoing education
Educational opportunities must be identified to help raise the baseline of the
PS literacy of the department. The more that physicians and staff
understand the overall climate of the department and the motivation behind
the case review and discussion, the easier it will be to create a more open
and accepting culture for PS/QI. The goal should be to create an atmosphere
of transparency without fear of shame or blame, make the reporting of
adverse events an easy process, and convey the commitment to learning and
continuous improvement.4 A transparent process will help create a culture
that supports reporting and discussion of cases; this will create an
environment that is safer for both patients and caretakers.
Joint Commission has stated that most perinatal adverse outcomes
usually result from lack of teamwork and effective communication. They
recommend team training to help staff work together and communicate
more effectively.7 One form of education that has demonstrated
improvement in maternal and neonatal outcomes is simulation of routine
and emergency situations. Simulations can both address clinical education
and improve the level of PS learning in a department. These simulations can
provide both the technical skills that the residents need and the
communication skills that are often necessary in situations that arise in
obstetrics. There are many options for simulation programs to best fit the
department, and they can be designed to meet the previously identified
needs and levels of medical education.8 Typically, simulations will include
all members of the OB care team—OB, Neonatology, Anesthesiology, and
Nursing—working together to solve the clinical problem that arises. These
simulations focus not just on the clinical aspect of care but also on the
essential communication and teamwork.

CLINICAL VIGNETTE
Mr. P was a 75-year-old gentleman with a history of smoking, hypertension,
and coronary artery disease who came to the hospital for a left neck
dissection. A few months earlier, he had undergone a resection of the floor
of the mouth and right neck dissection because of oral cancer. That
operation was followed by radiation therapy that couldn't stop the
progression of the disease.
On the day of this second surgery, Dr. A, the anesthesiologist, observed
the patient to have limited mouth opening and neck rigidity, likely
secondary to fibrosis of soft tissues caused by the radiation treatment.
Concerned by the possibility of difficult mask ventilation and laryngoscopy,
Dr. A decided to proceed with a fiberoptic intubation while maintaining the
spontaneous ventilation of the patient. The intubation was performed
successfully and without complications.
Before the end of the surgery, a junior anesthesiologist, Dr. Z, took over
the case from Dr. A. Dr. Z was informed that the intubation went
“smoothly,” although, in the handoff, there was no mention of the fiberoptic
approach. Reassured by the report of uncomplicated intubation, at the
request of the senior surgeon, Dr. Z agreed to extubate the patient “deep.”
This was meant to avoid “coughing and bucking” at emergence, which
could cause bleeding from the surgical site. After assessing full reversal of
neuromuscular blockade, Dr. Z inserted a lubricated airway into the left
nose hoping that this device would help the patient maintain the patency of
the upper airways after extubation. Then, Dr. Z removed the endotracheal
tube from the other nostril. This maneuver caused profuse nasal bleeding,
and the partially obtunded patient aspirated blood in the airway.
Immediately thereafter, Mr. P became unable to ventilate and his oxygen
saturation dropped. Dr. Z's attempts of mask ventilation and reintubation
under direct laryngoscopy failed because of the ongoing bleeding and
patient's very limited mouth opening. The patient had a hypoxic
cardiocirculatory arrest, and the surgeon was then forced to perform an
emergent cricothyrotomy that was challenging because of the extensive
neck fibrosis. Mr. P's oxygenation remained inadequate for more than 10
minutes, resulting in hypoxic brain injury and myocardial ischemia. The
patient was resuscitated and then admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU).
One week later, Mr. P had not regained consciousness and the ICU
physicians, after consulting with Mr. P's family, decided to withdraw care.
INTRODUCTION
The vignette illustrates several crucial elements of a safe anesthetic
management: a thorough and updated preoperative assessment, an
anesthetic plan that takes into consideration the individual characteristics of
patients and surgical procedures, competence in using advanced equipment
to manage difficult airways both at induction and at emergence from
anesthesia, and the ability to maintain situation awareness and effective
communication with all team members.
What steps of the anesthetic management could have helped in
preventing the unfolding of the adverse events illustrated in the vignette?
Patient Assessment and Plan
Reviewing the patient's treatment history and physical signs, such as his
limited mouth opening, properly alerted the first anesthesiologist of
possible difficulties both with intubation and face mask ventilation. This
recognition prompted a fiberoptic intubation while the patient's spontaneous
ventilation was maintained. In fact, the two main factors contributing to
difficult airway management following head and neck radiation therapy are
intense neck rigidity due to fibrosis and the presence of chronic airway
edema.
Advanced Airway Management
Had Dr. Z fully realized the challenges posed by the airway, he could have
planned a staged extubation using an airway exchange catheter (AEC). The
AEC is a thin, hollow rubber tube that can be used in an emergency
situation either to deliver oxygen via a Luer Lock connector or to attempt
some form of ventilation through an Ambu bag with a standard
endotracheal tube adapter. The AEC can also be used as a guide to
reintubate the patient. In this case, the AEC should be inserted in the
endotracheal tube before extubation. The endotracheal tube would then be
removed while leaving the AEC in the airway. This is generally well
tolerated even by awake, spontaneously breathing patients and can be left in
place safely for hours. Extubation of the difficult airway is a very
challenging, but often neglected, step of the anesthesia care.1
Communication and Situation Awareness
Unfortunately, Dr. A forgot to explain his reasoning in using the flexible
bronchoscope to his junior colleague. Consequently, Dr. Z did not take in
adequate consideration the perils of a “deep” extubation in a patient with
abnormal airway anatomy. In addition, it is very likely that the hierarchy
gradient between Dr. Z and the senior surgeon may have played a role in
this unfortunate outcome. The “senior” surgeon requested a “deep
extubation” for good reasons: “bucking” and “fighting” the ventilator may
have indeed increased the risk of bleeding from a neck surgical site. Still, a
senior anesthesiologist would have likely anticipated the complications that
may have followed a deep extubation in a patient with difficult airways and
would have been confident enough to remind the surgeon that a “deep”
extubation is safe only in patients with “easy” airways. On the contrary,
“junior” anesthesiologists may be reluctant to object to the requests of
senior surgeons for the fear of appearing inadequate or lacking self-
confidence. This type of communication issue is widely recognized, and the
accepted remedy is the development of an organizational culture where all
members of the team, regardless of their hierarchical status, feel safe to
speak up if they perceive that a dangerous situation is emerging.
The goal of this chapter is to review how anesthesiologists have come
to identify threats to patient safety in their field of activities and have been
able to develop effective strategies to prevent or mitigate patient harm
(Table 21-1). In addition, we will discuss emerging patient safety concerns
for those undergoing anesthesia in this era characterized by increased
medical knowledge and enhanced technologies but also by the necessity of
containing health care costs.

PATIENT SAFETY IN ANESTHESIA
For the purposes of this chapter, patient safety in anesthesia can be defined
as the prevention of unnecessary patient harm resulting from anesthesia
care.
Historically, the field of anesthesia has pioneered patient safety and
quality in health care. The fact that anesthesia is risky and not inherently
therapeutic has been recognized by caregivers for a long time.2 From the
very beginning of the specialty this awareness has led the anesthesiology
community to focus their clinical attention and research efforts toward
prevention of anesthesia-related mortality and complications. Interestingly,
anesthesiologists most likely contributed to the field the very term “patient
safety.” A PubMed search reveals that the two words appear joined for the
first time in the title of an article published in 1960 by Dr. Kreul, a leading
anesthesiologist from Wisconsin, who was arguing in favor of using
locoregional instead of general anesthesia for obstetric procedures.3 In
1978, Cooper published a seminal paper examining human error and
equipment failure in anesthesia practice. He discovered that 82% of
preventable adverse events were due to human error.4 The errors were often
due to issues with equipment and supplies, providers' overall inexperience,
unfamiliarity with the equipment/device, haste, inattention, fatigue, poor
communication, and inadequate training. This early work set the
groundwork for future innovation in anesthesia safety and quality. The
initial focus was mainly on mortality; then, the interest extended to a
progressively larger and articulated category of adverse events, such as
central and peripheral nervous system injuries, acute liver failure,
perioperative myocardial ischemia and cardiac arrest, respiratory failure,
and allergic reactions.
This clinical and research effort was nurtured and structured by the
establishment of the American Society of Anesthesiology Closed Claim
Project in 1984 and of the Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation (APSF) in
1985. The goals of the Closed Claims Project have been to identify “major
areas of loss, patterns of injury, and strategies for prevention” through an
in-depth investigation of closed anesthesia malpractice claims.5 The APSF's
mission is to continually improve the safety of anesthesia by promoting
research, education, and patient safety campaigns.6 Its main communication
tool is a newsletter distributed quarterly online and in paper copies. Both
organizations have supported acquisition and dissemination of knowledge
in patient safety and its translation into everyday clinical practice.
Adverse Outcomes in Anesthesia
Cases of anesthesia-related death have been reported since 1847, only a few
months after William Morton, a dentist in Boston, first demonstrated the
possibility of inducing general anesthesia with diethyl ether in surgical
patients.7 This event is considered by most historians as the starting date of
the modern practice of anesthesia, even if it is now established that ether
had already been used since 1842 by two other physicians, William E.
Clarke and Crawford W. Long, who missed to timely report their
experiences with this inhalational agent. In those early times of the
specialty, most fatalities were related to the use of ether, chloroform
(discovered in 1847 by the Scottish obstetrician James Young Simpson),
and other inhalational agents. In the years following World War II, Beecher
and Todd performed the first systematic investigation of anesthesia-related
mortality. Their study showed that in highly respected American academic
institutions, anesthesia mortality was 64 deaths for 100,000 procedures and
that patients receiving curare would die at the much higher rate of 1:370
versus 1:2100 in those who were not paralyzed.2 Since then, improved
understanding of cardiovascular and respiratory physiology; development
of safer anesthetic agents, equipment, and monitors; and standardization of
clinical care have produced a steady decline in perioperative and anesthetic-
related mortality (Table 21-1).
According to a recent review, anesthetic mortality decreased in
developed countries from 36 deaths every 100,000 procedures before the
1970s to 34 deaths per 100,000 procedures in the 1990s–2000s and, in
developing countries, from 1 death every 100 procedure to 1 death every
1000 procedures over the same time interval, notwithstanding the larger
number of surgeries performed on more compromised patients.7
Still, when data related to 30- or 60-day outcomes are available
(allowing to account for anesthesia risk, but even more for surgical and
medical risk), it appears that postoperative mortality is still a very
significant burden. A recent study conducted in Europe8 showed that up to
4% of patients die within 60 days from their initial surgery, and similar
results were reported in the US.9 Interestingly, in the above mentioned
European study, even after adjustment for confounding variables, crude
mortality rates varied widely between countries (from 1.2% for Iceland to
21.5% for Latvia). This large discrepancy in the observed perioperative
mortality8 suggests that models of hospital care, staffing, and overall
national medical practices of health care delivery may have a role in
determining patient outcomes. This interpretation of the results of the study
calls for the implementation of improvement projects to impact directly on
the most important perioperative outcomes: patient morbidity and mortality.
Along with mortality, anesthesia can be associated with multiple
complications. 
In 
anesthesiology, 
airway 
and 
respiratory 
issues,
cardiovascular complications, drug-related events, and neurologic injuries
account for the most severe adverse outcomes, together with procedure-
related complications and equipment failure.10,11 Patients at particular risk
of severe anesthesia-related complications are those with significant
comorbidities (as captured by the American Society of Anesthesiology
physical status score), those in the extremes of age, pregnant women,
patients undergoing monitored anesthesia care in remote locations, and
patients receiving procedures for chronic pain.10–12 More recently, new
issues have been taken under growing consideration including long-term
cardiac morbidity and mortality, delirium, postoperative cognitive
dysfunction, awareness, chronic pain after surgery, patient satisfaction with
the perioperative experience, and other parameters assessing patient
outcomes.13
Emerging research is focusing on the possibility of long-term
unfavorable outcomes secondary to the administration of anesthesia and to
perioperative management. Ongoing developments in this area may have a
significant impact on the way patient safety in anesthesia will be
approached in the near future.
Over the last few years, the attention of researchers and of the general
public has been directed toward the possibility that general anesthesia may
cause brain damage. One concern is that, in young children, anesthesia-
related neurotoxicity may cause neuroapoptosis and impairment of
developmental processes such as neurogenesis and synaptogenesis possibly
leading to long-lasting behavioral and learning deficits, severe enough to
impair future achievements throughout the entire course of life.14 In senior
patients, serious consequences may be delirium and postoperative cognitive
dysfunction. Both delirium and postoperative cognitive dysfunction may be
secondary to the inflammatory response induced by major surgical
procedures and are associated with longer hospital stay and increased
mortality.
Besides cognitive issues, the concept that anesthesia care may influence
patient outcome far beyond hospital discharge is recurring in other clinical
areas: in 1996, Mangano15 reported that in-hospital administration of
atenolol was associated with decreased overall and cardiac mortality after
noncardiac surgery for up to two years. Today, the results of that study (as
well as the optimal perioperative use of β-blockers) are considered quite
controversial, but the hypothesis that perioperative management may have
an impact on long-term outcomes still appears plausible. Also debated are
the hypotheses that intraoperative blood transfusions may increase cancer
recurrence rate and that the use of locoregional anesthesia may instead have
a preventive effect on the development of tumor metastases.16,17
Ongoing Safety Issues in Anesthesia:
Equipment Failures and Drug Errors
Another current concern is that safety issues with anesthesia equipment and
drug administration are still prevalent, notwithstanding the many
technologic improvements that have been obtained in these areas. Actually,
some of the present problems with anesthesia machines are the “flip side”
of the evolution of the technology. Closed-circuit anesthesia machines and
ventilators have grown more powerful but also more complex, because of
the many components and the computer-driven controls. It is of essence that
anesthesia providers gain familiarity with all anesthesia machines in their
practice, as they may differ in specific preuse checkout, modality of use,
and maintenance. The American Society of Anesthesiology has made
available a very useful library of machine-specific preuse checklists.18
External infusion pumps have also been involved in patient safety
events. These medical devices deliver fluids and drugs to patients at a
controlled rate, thereby reducing medication errors and improving patient
care. Unfortunately, because of either mechanical or software issues,
problems of over- or underinfusion are common, leading to erroneous,
missed, or delayed treatments.19 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration
has recently noticed an increasing number and severity of recalls involving
infusion pumps. Recognizing that currently none of the available devices is
completely safe, the Food and Drug Administration is promoting strategies
to help reduce pump-related risk due to design deficiencies or software
errors and supporting the development of effective premarket tests for these
devices.
Medication errors are a recognized and relatively common cause of
anesthetic morbidity and mortality. The rate of drug administration errors is
estimated around 1 case for every 133 anesthetics.20 The most reported
errors are incorrect doses and drug substitutions. These errors are so
prevalent because anesthesia providers commonly prescribe, draw, and
administer drugs directly to patients without additional controls or
intermediate steps that may help to catch errors. As suggested in 2010 by
APSF, preventative strategies should be multimodal and include
standardization. In particular, the following strategies have been proposed
and are increasingly adopted: standardization of drugs' concentration,
administration through infusion devices containing a drug library with
preset dose ranges (although, as discussed above, there may be issues with
diffusion devices as well; therefore, vigilance is always imperative), use of
labels including standardized abbreviations and tall man lettering (e.g.,
writing part of a drug's name in uppercase letters to highlight the dissimilar
letters in two soundalike, look-alike drugs, thereby helping providers to
distinguish between the two), adoption of advanced technology (bar code
readers with read-back capability), pharmacy/prefilled/premixed drugs,
standardization of anesthesia carts within institutions, and safety culture
(reporting, cooperation).21
Finally, over the last few years, drug shortages have emerged as a new
and significant problem affecting patient safety in the perioperative
environment. Medication shortages are defined as “the lack of available
supply that results in a change in the way the medication is prepared by the
pharmacy, or as the need to change patient management, requiring
prescribers to select a therapeutic alternative.”22 Medication shortage often
involves intravenous drugs; as a result, the way anesthesia is practiced is
frequently affected, and hundreds of errors attributed to medication
shortages are reported annually despite the fact that hospital pharmacists
have developed increasing experience and competence in managing these
situations. The American Society of Health-Systems Pharmacists website23
provides a web page where it is possible to find a list of current and
resolved drug shortages, as well as policies and best practices to deal with
these challenges when they occur.
QUALITY 
IMPROVEMENT 
IN
ANESTHESIA
In the practice of anesthesia, while patient safety and quality of care are
closely related, it is difficult to find major outcome measures that are
sensitive enough to the quality of care delivery.24,25 For example, mortality
is currently so rare that it has become a poor quality indicator. Even medical
complications are not linearly related to quality of anesthesia care, as these
unwanted perioperative outcomes are frequently secondary to patient and
surgical factors.
In the US, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), in
an effort to assess and monitor quality of care, has launched the Physician
Quality Reporting System (PQRS), a reporting program that uses a
combination of incentive payments and payment adjustments to encourage
health care professionals to report on specific quality measures.26
In 2015, most anesthesia eligible providers (EPs) are required by CMS
to report nine measures related to three National Quality Strategy domains.
These domains include Patient and Family Engagement, Patient Safety,
Care Coordination, Population and Public Health, Efficient Use of Health
Care Resources, and Clinical Processes/Effectiveness.
While most EPs can identify and report quality measures specific of
their 
practice 
settings, 
“traditional” 
measures 
for 
physician
anesthesiologists include the following: preoperative β-blocker in patients
with isolated coronary artery bypass graft surgery; prevention of catheter-
related bloodstream infections; and perioperative temperature management.
The Anesthesia Quality Institute has recently proposed the definition
and the adoption of comprehensive and specific sets of indicators to assess
intraoperative, postoperative, and postrecovery patient safety and quality of
care outcomes (Figs. 21-1 to 21-3) and is developing a process to
systematically collect comprehensive data at a national level.

The goal of this initiative is to overcome two of the historical difficulties
that have so far prevented consistent and accurate measurements of the risk
of anesthesia and of the impact of complications on patient outcomes: the
absence of (1) unequivocal definitions of anesthesia-related mortality and
morbidity and (2) adequate and reliable population data.
In fact, until recently, comprehensive national data have not been
systematically collected in most countries, with the possible exception of
Australia and New Zealand. Most of the currently accepted knowledge on
the safety of anesthesia is based on the extrapolation of results of
investigations performed on relatively small numbers of patients, with data
frequently collected over limited periods of time, and in specific geographic
locations, thus limiting an exact understanding of incidence and
mechanisms of complications. In the near future, more information and
insight will be provided by large registries of anesthesia cases.
Table 21-2 provides a recent illustration of the relevant information on
complications and anesthesia-related deaths that is currently collected
almost in real time and analyzed by the Anesthesia Quality Institute. Since
its inception in 2010, the National Anesthesia Clinical Outcomes Registry
(NACOR) has collected information about administration and outcome of
anesthesia care for more than 32 million of cases (and currently captures
25% of all anesthesia cases performed in the US). This unprecedented and
capillary acquisition of electronic information is made possible by the
connection with billing systems, quality management systems, and hospital
and anesthesia health records26 of many institutions and anesthesia
practices. A current limitation is that the system is not yet set to collect 30-
day or 1-year outcomes, thereby missing the opportunity to gain insight on
longer-term clinical consequences of anesthesia.

This table was kindly provided by the Anesthesia Quality Institute and is
based on the data available on August 26, 2013. “The data presented are
rough aggregates of what is collected in NACOR, based on a minimum
number of practices which report that outcome. Definitions vary from
practice to practice, especially in the ‘minor’ category.
* Not all practices report all outcomes. This creates varying denominators for rate calculations.
Consequently, some outcomes might have a higher count (N) but a lower rate (%) as compared to
others.”
A meaningful example of the unique information that researchers and
administrators can gain from the exploration of large databases is provided
by the two following studies.
In 2009, Kheterpal reviewed the electronic record of more than 50,000
anesthesia records and was able to estimate that the rate of impossible mask
ventilation following induction of anesthesia is 0.15%. This situation poses
a significant threat to anesthetized patients, when they have lost the
capacity to ventilate following the administration of induction drugs and the
anesthesia provider is unable to ventilate them by mask and bag valve mask
resuscitator (e.g., Ambu bag). In the setting of a difficult or impossible
intubation, the inability to provide oxygenation to a patient who is not
breathing spontaneously may lead to severe consequences, such as hypoxic
brain damage or death. This study was the first to reliably assess the
incidence of impossible mask ventilation in anesthetized subjects.
In addition, the investigators identified and validated several predictors
of impossible mask ventilation, such as previous radiation treatment of the
neck, male sex, sleep apnea, Mallampati III or IV, and presence of beard.
These clinical predictors can all be easily assessed during the preoperative
evaluation of surgical candidates, allowing anesthesia providers to
customize the anesthetic management on the characteristics of the patient
and possibly improving the safety of anesthesia induction.27
In 2013, Bateman, by reviewing a data set of more than 140,000
surgical and obstetric patients collected by the Multicenter Perioperative
Outcomes Group, was able to estimate an incidence of epidural hematomas
requiring surgical evacuation following epidural catheterization ranging
between 1 event per 4300 and 1 event per 22,000 epidural catheter
placement.28 Such information is valuable both in guiding anesthetic
management and promoting shared decision making with the patient.
Patient experience is an increasingly important component of the
quality of anesthesia: it encompasses the full spectrum of anesthesia care,
from the preoperative assessment to the discharge process. At present, there
are numerous valid questionnaires to measure patient satisfaction with
anesthesia care that can be applied to different clinical settings and patient
populations29; those metrics can provide adequate information to conduct
and assess the outcomes of improvement initiatives, if used systematically.
To make sense of collected quality data and drive improvement efforts,
a rigorous statistical approach is needed. Statistical process control is the
method of quality control applied to these purposes. In addition, statistical
methods to recognize “outlier” providers or performances are also
increasingly pursued.30 Of note, it is recognized that feeding-back
information concerning performance data to providers is paramount to
increase the understanding of their practice and to promote the acceptance
of changes aiming at improving quality of care.24
Finally, quality of anesthesia care is based on the systematic application
of 
minimum 
clinical 
standards, 
evidence-based 
guidelines, 
and
recommendations promoted by professional societies. In the US, the
American Society of Anesthesiologists publishes and periodically updates
practice parameters to guide clinicians toward high-quality clinical
behaviors. In 2007, the European Society of Anaesthesiology published
their “Guidelines for safety and quality in anaesthesia practice in the
European Union.”31 The two societies have very similar perspectives and
goals. They both support the following concepts:
All anesthesiologic medical work should be led and personally
supervised by a physician anesthesiologist.
Patients should be assessed and optimized preoperatively; equipment
should be available and be consistent with minimum standards or
guidelines.
Syringes containing drugs should be color coded.
Clinical and administrative documentation should be complete and
intelligible.
Of note, the European guidelines place a greater focus on the fact that
anesthesia providers have an obligation to minimize fatigue in the context
in which they are working while employers have an obligation to optimize
rosters and working/resting conditions to minimize the risk of fatigued
anesthetists. These principles were also received in a European Working
Hour Directive.31 In the US, the Joint Commission has acknowledged the
link between fatigue, patient safety events, and quality of care (sentinel
event alert 48 and Ref.32), but no working hour limitations have been
enforced by the specialty governing bodies, with the exception of the
Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education that restricted
working hours for residents of all specialties.
Finally, the American Society of Anesthesiology has recently joined the
“Choosing Wisely” campaign,33 an initiative of the American Board of
Internal Medicine Foundation, whose focus is to encourage “physicians,
patients and other health care stakeholders to think and talk about medical
tests and procedures that may be unnecessary, and in some instances can
cause harm.” The five measures identified by the American Society of
Anesthesiology (ASA) are reported in Table 21-3.
TABLE 21-3 Choosing Wisely Campaign: The American Society of
Anesthesiology Has Proposed the Following Five Recommendations
(http://www.choosingwisely.org/doctor-patient-lists/american-society-of-
anesthesiologists/)
PROMOTING PATIENT SAFETY IN
THE PRACTICE OF ANESTHESIA
The science of complexity has clarified that accidents and adverse
outcomes are likely in complex systems where multiple agents perform
several simultaneous tasks generating nonlinear and, therefore, largely
unpredictable interactions and outcomes.33
The clinical work of anesthesia providers is certainly complex because
it involves dealing with patients that are vulnerable due to age and/or
comorbidities, surgical procedures that alter normal physiology, emergency
conditions, and time pressure, all the while striving for efficiency,
multitasking, and cooperating with many surgeons and consultants with
different priorities and mind-sets.
In this context, the goal of preventing patient harm should be based on
principles derived from cognitive psychology, human factors, and system
thinking. Therefore, the leadership of every anesthesia practice or academic
department should be engaged in building and sustaining a resilient and
highly reliable system, capable of minimizing the chances of errors of
clinicians and mitigating the adverse consequences of medical mistakes on
patient outcomes.
A first important step in this direction is to design and implement an
organized pathway for patient flow across all of the different phases of the
perioperative period, from the preoperative assessment to the discharge
from the hospital, to assure an effective and efficient patient management
and to prevent fragmentation of care. In addition, the scheduling of elective
and emergent cases should guarantee adequate first-line personnel and
supervision and help minimizing providers' fatigue.
The leadership should support and assess providers' performance.
Providers' skills can be promoted through training, in-services, and
maintenance of competences sessions. Furthermore, there is currently a
strong consensus that good communication and teamwork are essential to
promote patient safety. An interesting development in this area consists in
adopting medical simulation for maintaining clinical competences and
promoting nontechnical skills.33 Similar to aviation, simulation has become
a standard approach used to teach nontechnical skills (situation awareness,
communication, teamwork, leadership, etc.) to health care providers.32 Of
note, assessing providers' performance is requested and regulated by the
Joint Commission for accreditation purposes (ongoing and focused provider
performance evaluation).
An additional and essential safety and quality measure in clinical
practice consists in standardizing care according to evidence-based clinical
protocols. Furthermore, the systematic adoption and implementation of
surgery checklists, such as the one proposed by World Health Organization,
have been effective in decreasing perioperative complications and
mortality.29 It is currently acknowledged that checklists are more effective
when “adjusted” to local realities, and the whole health care team
participates in their execution, with “active voice” and “reading back.”
Importantly, a “routine debriefing” at the end of the procedure is a very
effective tool to generate a shared understanding of “what went well and
what went wrong,” to establish next clinical priorities and to plan the next
steps of patient management.
Another critical component of delivering state-of-the-art anesthesia care
is the availability of adequate monitors and equipment (anesthesia
machines, difficult airways cart, ultrasound for vascular access and regional
anesthesia, rapid infusion systems, infusion pumps with drugs library and
limits). Anesthesia information management systems can support safe
practices when they are configured to deploy electronic reminders (e.g., for
the administration of antibiotics), to provide decision support (for instance,
operating room crisis checklists), and to facilitate reporting adverse events
and near misses. It is likely that in the near future, the integration and
analysis of physiologic signals coming from different monitors will allow
clinicians to timely recognize patterns of situations at risk of adverse
outcome,33 thereby triggering appropriate interventions.
While information technology can be a major tool in supporting patient
safety and quality efforts, it is crucial to maintain a balanced and realistic
perspective on its current limitations. In particular, information technology
that does not take into consideration clinicians' workflow may be distracting
and represent an additional burden on clinical performance and patient
safety.31
A final necessary step to promote patient safety is to establish a
consistent process for reporting adverse events and near misses. Such an
effort should include dedicating enough personnel and resources to collect
and analyze performance data and to review complicated cases (under the
umbrella of peer-review or morbidity and mortality conferences). To make
sure that the “lessons learned” are not forgotten, the understanding gained
in the review process should ultimately be translated into system
improvements and increased providers' knowledge.
It is also imperative to assure that, in case of patient complications,
adverse events are properly disclosed to patient and family members.
Disclosure is often more effective if performed in collaboration with other
services involved in the care of the patient. In the field of anesthesia, the
development and implementation of effective system improvements
frequently depend on the anesthesiologists' capacity to cooperate with other
hospital services involved in the perioperative care of patients.
In conclusion, it is the interest of our society to make medicine more
effective and safer, but also affordable and accessible to all. To this goal, it

is vital to eliminate waste in health care and to “bend the health care cost
curve.”35 It is a present challenge to guarantee that anesthesia clinical
processes are safe and effective and, at the same time, economically
sustainable. The approach that every single institution will adopt to match
this financial priority will have an impact on the way anesthesia care is
delivered and influence the distribution of roles and responsibilities among
the members of the anesthesia team: physicians, nurse anesthetists, and
anesthesia assistants.
SUMMARY
Anesthesiologists have contributed to create the discipline of patient
safety and have emerged as leaders and innovators in this field.
Perioperative outcomes have improved due to the development of
standards of care, enhanced providers' training, and technical and
organizational progresses.
New concerns are emerging of a possible negative long-term impact of
anesthesia on neurologic patient outcomes such as postoperative
cognitive dysfunction in elderly patients and acquired learning
disability in young children.
Data acquisition from large electronic databases and analysis is
providing increasing opportunities to understand predictors and
measure outcomes of anesthesia-related adverse events.
Ongoing developments of anesthesia management information systems
including decision support and adverse event reporting capabilities
may play a major role in supporting patient safety and quality of care
at the front line.

CLINICAL VIGNETTE
A 35-year-old 180-kg man with a history of obstructive sleep apnea and
hypertension undergoes an uneventful laparoscopic gastric banding. He is
discharged from the recovery room to the observation unit with morphine
patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) for postoperative analgesia and will be
monitored with intermittent pulse oximetry. At 02:00, he is found
unconscious and unresponsive in pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest.
He is successfully resuscitated but has a devastating neurologic injury and
care is withdrawn 10 days later.
Could telemonitoring or tele-intensive care unit (ICU) have prevented
this complication?
What is the role for a rapid response team (RRT) in decompensating
patients?
How could bundles or protocols be used to prevent complications or
near misses?
INTRODUCTION
Critical care units, by their nature, care for the sickest patients in any
hospital, and most patients have one or more organ failures being supported
at once. Patients are often completely dependent on pharmacologic or
mechanical support, have numerous continuous and intermittent monitors of
physiologic function, and have ongoing testing and evaluation. These
patients are also cared for by an extensive team consisting of intensivists,
consultants, nurses, clinical pharmacists, physical therapists, and
occupational therapists. Because of the complex nature of the patients, the
disease, and the care team, patient safety and quality improvement activities
are an absolute necessity in the ICU. This chapter will briefly review the
role of telemonitoring or tele-ICU, trigger tools and RRTs, and the use of
bundles and protocols in the ICU.
TELEMONITORING/TELE-ICU
Telemonitoring or tele-ICU means many different things to many different
people.1 It could be as simple as a cardiac telemetry technician monitoring a
cardiac telemetry floor in a hospital or as complex as a remote monitoring
location staffed with a team of teleintensivists and tele-ICU nurses
continuously monitoring more than 100 patients in many ICUs at several
hospitals with the use of real-time, continuous two-way audio/video robotic
communication and complex computerized clinical decision support tools.
This section will focus on the more comprehensive (and expensive)
tele-ICU model. In 2010, it was estimated that tele-ICU programs were in
use in more than 40 US health care systems covering more than 4900 adult
ICU beds in several hundred hospitals. A hospital's tele-ICU system
typically consists of a monitoring location, which may be remote or on site
and staffed by teleintensivists and nurses with the ability for real-time two-
way audio and video communications. Typically, each intensivist can
oversee up to 150 patients, and each tele-ICU nurse can observe 30–45
patients.2 Several studies have evaluated the effectiveness of telemedicine.
It should be noted that all of these studies are before-versus-after studies
that are subject to bias. Lilly et al. reported the results of implementation of
a tele-ICU system at a single academic institution in 7 ICUs with over 6000
patients over 17 months. They found that after implementation, there were
significant decreases in adjusted mortality (13.6% vs. 11.8%, adjusted odds
ratio [OR] 0.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.31–0.52), ventilator-
associated pneumonia (VAP) (13% vs. 1.6%, OR 0.15, 95% CI 0.09–0.23),
catheter-related infection, and hospital stay. They also showed improved
compliance with best practice and protocol adherence.3 Willmitch et al.
examined the before-versus-after results in 10 adult ICUs in a 5-hospital
community health system over a 4-year period involving more than 24,000
patients. They showed that the tele-ICU was associated with a 23%
decrease in the relative risk of adjusted mortality (95% CI 0.69–0.87; p <
0.001) and a 14% decrease severity-adjusted hospital length of stay (LOS)
(p < 0.001) and a 13% decrease in ICU LOS (p < 0.001).4 Young et al.
performed a systematic review and meta-analysis on the impact of tele-ICU
on patient outcomes. They included 13 studies from 35 ICUs involving
more than 41,000 patients. Tele-ICU was associated with a decrease in ICU
mortality (OR 0.8, 95% CI 0.66–0.097; p = 0.02) and ICU LOS (−1.2 days,
95% CI −7.21 to −0.03; p = 0.01). However, there was no difference in
hospital mortality (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.65–1.03; p = 0.08) or hospital LOS
(mean reduction of 0.64 days; 95% CI −1.52 to 0.25; p = 0.16).5 The
authors commented on several serious limitations in tele-ICU studies to
date including the huge differences in tele-ICU models and implementation,
before-versus-after study design, and the fact that most studies have been
funded by the vendors of these systems.
These systems are expensive. Start-up costs are in the range of $2 to $5
million per ICU, and annual operating costs may be $1 million per year per
ICU.6 Franzini et al. evaluated the costs and cost-effectiveness of a tele-
ICU system from more than 4000 patients in 6 ICUs in a five-hospital
system. They showed that tele-ICU increased hospital daily cost ($4302 to
$5340), hospital cost per case ($21,967 to $31,318), and cost per patient
($20,231 to $25,846). This study showed that in patients with a simplified
acute physiology score (SAPS II), the tele-ICU did not change hospital
mortality, and they were not cost-effective. On the other hand, in patients
with a SAPS II >50, mortality decreased from 30.7% to 19.3% and tele-ICU
was cost-effective. Kumar performed a systematic review and analysis on
eight studies and from a network of seven Veteran's Health Administration
(VHA) hospitals. They found the implementation and first-year costs to be
$50,000 to $100,000 per bed. Hospital costs were even more difficult to
predict and ranged from a reduction to $3000 per patient to an increase of
$5600. The authors point out several limitations of these data including the
lack of outcome and cost-effectiveness data, the different methods of
depreciation 
calculations, 
and 
difficulties 
in 
obtaining 
actual
implementation costs.7
In conclusion, definitive studies showing the outcome and cost-
effectiveness of tele-ICUs have not been done. However, as Marcin et al.
commented in a recent review of a pediatric tele-ICU, “tele-medicine, in
and of itself, will not result in improved care. Rather, tele-medicine is a
technologic tool that can enable providers to provide better care.”8
TRIGGER TOOLS
Patient safety has become a top priority in health care. Many changes and
new protocols to improve patient safety have been suggested and
implemented since the original report on deaths resulting from preventable
medical errors from the Institute of Medicine (IOM) in 1999. It has been
suggested that the tracking of adverse events (AEs), or harm to patients, can
be used to evaluate the success or failure of safety processes.
There are several ways to track AEs. Voluntary reporting by health care
providers is often incomplete. The Agency for Healthcare Research and
Quality defined patient safety indicators (PSIs) using ICD-9 diagnosis
codes from administrative discharge data, literature review, clinical panels,
and empirical analysis, whereas the Institute of Healthcare Improvement
(IHI) uses a list of triggers with a systematic chart review process
(http://www.qualityindicators.ahrq.gov/modules/psi_resources.aspx.
Accessed 12/10/15). According to the IHI, the use of “triggers,” or clues, to
identify AEs is an effective method for measuring the overall level of harm
from medical care in a health care organization. The focus of these trigger
tools is somewhat different in that they are designed to find harm related to
medical care whether or not it was the result of an error.9
Harm is classified in categories according to the National Coordinating
Council for Medication Error Reporting and Prevention (NCC MERP). For
a full list of the NCC MERP error reporting classifications, see Chapter 13,
Event Analysis.
A. Temporary harm that required intervention B. Temporary harm that
required ICU readmission or prolonged hospitalization C. Permanent harm
D. Intervention required to sustain life E. Patient death (not related to
medical care)
Traditional efforts to detect AEs have focused on voluntary reporting and
tracking errors. However, only 10–20% of all errors are reported, and of
those, 90–95% cause no harm to patients. The ICU AE trigger tool is based
on IHI's global trigger tool (GTT). There are various trigger tools available
at IHI.org for use in different settings: the GTT for measuring AEs, trigger
tools for measuring adverse drug events in general or in specific settings,
such as in a children's hospital, a mental health setting, or nursing homes.
Trigger tools are also available for use in specific populations or during
specific periods such as in the perioperative surgical population, during the
perinatal period, or for use in the neonatal ICU.
According to the IHI, these trigger tools provide an easy-to-use method
for accurately identifying AEs and measuring the rate of AEs over time. The
process is standardized: charts are randomly selected by trained reviewers
throughout the year, and to maximize efficiency, time is limited to 20
minutes per chart. Rather than a page-by-page review of the chart, the
trigger tool uses a predefined checklist of triggers. Specific areas of the
charts are queried to look for the trigger, and if the trigger is found, then
further relevant information is searched for in the chart in order to make an
informed judgment as to whether the trigger resulted in an AE. The trigger
“positive blood culture” will lead the reviewer to search in the summary
section for microbiology, whereas naloxone administration will be searched
for in the medication administration record (MAR). Electronic records
provide the ability to improve efficiency of the searching process, some of
which can be automated.
The ICU AE trigger tool is designed to identify harmful events in the
ICU and uses records of patients who have been in the ICU for at least 2
days. The trigger tool does not track errors that do not lead to harm. The
GTT has a very high detection rate. However, since the medical record is
not searched from front to back and since there is no gold standard for
detecting AEs, the true sensitivity and specificity of these tools remain
unknown.
There is currently little published data on the utility and validity of
these tools. Landrigan et al. used the GTT during their retrospective study
of a stratified random sample of 10 hospitals in North Carolina and found
that during the period of January 2002 through December 2007, there was
no significant change in overall rate of harm. When using the GTT, they
showed very good internal interrater reliability but very poor agreement by
external reviewers.10 Mattsson et al. used the GTT in a high-volume
oncology service in Denmark. The two review teams identified mean AEs
of 32–37 per 1000 admission days. They concluded that different review
teams identified different AEs and reached different conclusions on the
safety process. They showed that only 31% of all AEs were identified by
both teams with only moderate interrater agreement (κ = 0.45) between
teams. This gave rise to different conclusions on the safety process. Another
concern is that there is poor agreement among teams in the categorization
of identified AEs especially when related to temporary harm. They also
pointed out that mean values of harm rates were within the measurement
error of the GTT. Therefore, making changes in the harm rate is almost
impossible to track unless AEs doubled.11
It is clear that different detection methods identify different AEs. Some
suggest combining these different methodologies to measure patient safety
for internal quality improvement (Table 22-1).

It is clear that the incidence of AEs remains very high. AEs are often
unrecognized or not reported. While multiple safety initiatives have been
proposed and implemented since the landmark report by the Institute of
Medicine (IOM), evidence of any dramatic beneficial effect on improving
outcomes in patient safety is still lacking. Some of these patient safety
initiatives may not go far enough or may have unintended or unrecognized
negative effects. Press et al. examined the impact of resident duty hour
reform on hospital readmission rates, as well as death during the admission
or within 30 days of discharge, and found no changes associated with
resident duty hour reform.12
RAPID RESPONSE TEAMS FOR
DECOMPENSATING PATIENTS
Survival to discharge after inhospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation by so-
called code teams remains only 7–26%.13 This failure to rescue patients,
and evidence to suggest that most serious AEs are preceded by clinically
observable warning signs, has led to the development of the rapid response
team (RRT). RRT is a multidisciplinary group of hospital personnel that
respond promptly to acutely deteriorating patients outside of the ICU. The
rapid response system uses various terms and definitions such as RRT (led
by a nurse, with or without physician consultation available), medical
emergency team, a medical emergency response team (physician leads the
team), or critical care outreach teams (ICU-based teams that follow general
ward patients).14 There is considerable heterogeneity in the application of
these terms. For the purposes of this discussion, we will use the term
RRT.15
RRTs were widely implemented following publication of five single
center studies that made before-and-after comparisons. These studies
showed a reduction in the rate of cardiac arrests and more care provided to
patients by the RRT. The effectiveness of the RRT however remains
somewhat controversial.15 The large multicenter cluster-randomized
controlled trial called the Medical Early Response Intervention and Therapy
(MERIT) study failed to demonstrate any direct benefit.16 Even though
RRTs have been shown to reduce cardiopulmonary arrests outside of the
ICU, subsequent meta-analyses also have failed to demonstrate a significant
reduction in hospital-wide mortality in adult patients after RRT
implementation. Beitler et al. were one of the first to show a benefit. In a
long-term cohort study from 2003 to 2008, following more than 150,000
patients admitted to a tertiary facility, they showed that RRTs were
associated with a significant reduction in unadjusted hospital-wide
mortality, out-of-ICU mortality, and out-of-ICU cardiopulmonary arrest
codes. The reduction in hospital-wide mortality remained statistically
significant even after adjusting for inpatient mortality trend over time.17
RRTs were widely introduced without level 1 evidence showing
effectiveness. Clinicians need to understand the controversies surrounding
them. While they have many potential benefits as “rescue” therapy, the
primary goal should still focus at preventing these events in the first place
and fostering a culture of patient safety.
USE 
OF 
BUNDLES 
AND
PROTOCOLS TO IMPROVE CARE
Bundles, protocols, and guidelines are all important in the care of the ICU
patient and to standardize care to improve quality and outcomes.
Nomenclature of these items is often confusing and overlapping. For the
purpose of this review, guidelines are evidence-based statements on how to
provide optimal care of a particular patient condition, such as what
antibiotics should be routinely used for undifferentiated ventilator
associated pneumonia (VAP). Protocols are then an extension of those
guidelines, particularly centered on patient care flow or how to
“operationalize” a guideline based on the structure of one's own ICU. In
many organizations, the terms “protocol” and “guidelines” are used more or
less interchangeably, likely due to perceived legal ramifications of using
certain terms over others. An ICU bundle is a set of treatment goals (usually
three to seven) that, when grouped and achieved together over a finite time
span, are believed to promote optimal outcomes.18
Initially, care bundles were promulgated by the Institute for Healthcare
Improvement.19 Bundle-driven care is grounded in evidence-based
medicine. The various components of the bundle have been shown in
various studies to be effective, although all components of individual
bundles may not have the backing of level-one evidence, namely, two or
more randomized controlled trials. Bundles exist for many disease patterns,
such as VAP, preventing surgical site infections, or treatment of sepsis.
Figure 22-1 shows a typical sepsis bundle. Multiple studies have shown that
bundles can improve outcomes.20–22 Unfortunately, most of those trials
have been retrospective in nature and based on historical controls. Bundles
likely help most by promoting consistency in the care of clinical
conditions.23 Critics of bundles point to the fact that the data are lacking in
randomized trials, some items of a successful bundle may in fact not
contribute to positive outcomes and may even be harmful, “cookbook”
medicine is not for individual patients, and regulators and payers may use
bundle adherence as an incorrect measure of quality.24
Figure 22-1 Surviving sepsis campaign care bundles. (From Dellinger RP,
Levy M, Rhodes A, et al. Surviving sepsis campaign: international
guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock, 2012.
Intensive Care Med. 2013;39(2):165–228.)
Protocols have much more prospective data with good information on
everything from weaning mechanical ventilation to ensuring compliance to
one's own list of best practices.25,26 Protocols are usually developed at the
institution or unit level, in response either to a safety event or to standardize
care based on new research or evidence-based guidelines. In the past, in
spite of good evidence, guidelines have not always taken hold in bedside
care. Protocols develop a pathway so that such evidence-based care is
consistently applied to the correct patient scenario, and compliance with the
protocols can be easily measured as a marker of quality. By standardizing
care, they may also decrease costs by improving outcomes and decreasing
variability. Decreasing variability has been shown to decrease the amount of
testing, such as eliminating standard daily labs, thereby decreasing cost.
In practice, all of these tools must be used while understanding their
benefits and shortcomings. We know that not every patient can have all of
his or her care directed by protocol, but there is a large component of
everyday care that can be governed by information from well-validated
studies. The practicing ICU physician should be a part of the team that
develops ICU and organizational protocols based on evidence-based
guidelines and local practice patterns. When there are several of these that
relate to a single disease process, they can be included in a care bundle.
These practices will provide consistency and reduce variability in those
patients, allow data collection and elucidate change if the protocol proves
ineffective. The practitioner must also recognize either when a patient does
not fit a given protocol or when such prescribed care is not effective. In
those cases, the true art of medicine, including experience and judgment,
must come above standardized care. In other words, we should use these
tools to make sure we apply well-proven elements of care, leaving our time
for the truly difficult dilemmas that we encounter in the ICU on a daily
basis. In the clinical vignette, it is likely that a protocol to recognize
potential sleep apnea patients and a bundle that included continuous central
monitoring and limiting narcotics (all recommended guidelines) could have
prevented such a devastating event.

Studies of telemedicine are limited by before-versus-after study
design, heterogeneity, and potential bias.
Telemedicine is expensive, and cost-effectiveness studies are
limited.
Trigger tools have been developed to provide an easy-to-use
method for accurately identifying AEs related to medical care.
Currently, there is little published data on the utility and validity
of these trigger tools.
Multidisciplinary RRTs were developed to respond promptly to
acutely deteriorating inpatients outside the ICU. Statistically, their
effectiveness remains somewhat controversial.
Bundles are a set of treatment goals that are grouped together to
provide optimal patient care.
Protocols are extensions of evidenced-based guidelines that
promote consistency and aid in quality data collection.
Bundles and protocols are not perfect, need to evolve, and should
never replace clinical decision making.

CLINICAL VIGNETTE
Mrs. Stevens has been in hallway bed 7 of the emergency department
(ED) for 20 hours. During the third handoff in her care, oncoming
providers are told that she has pneumonia and is admitted and waiting
for a bed. The trauma pager goes off and a nurse asks the off-going
doctor for a prescription for a patient being discharged. Sign-out ends
quickly, and as the team finishes responding to the trauma, a nurse
says “I need your help. Mrs. Stevens in hallway 7 is hypotensive,
tachycardic, and short of breath.” Review of her record reveals that she
has missed a dose of antibiotics and that she never received a third liter
of fluid resuscitation. Now she is septic and will require intubation,
resuscitation, and admission to an intensive care unit (ICU).
What system issues contributed to this and similar common
scenarios?
What measures can prevent such cases?
INTRODUCTION: 
THE 
ED
MINEFIELD
The ED is a unique and dynamic setting with the principal mission of the
acute stabilization and disposition of patients, sometimes described as
managing chaos. The ED now accounts for nearly one-third of the 354
million annual acute care visits in the United States, practically all acute
care provided after hours and on weekends, more acute care for the
uninsured than in all other settings combined, and nearly 50% of hospital
admissions in the US. The ED is increasingly the site of care of last resort
for the most vulnerable and underresourced patients.1,2 Many features of
work in the ED (illustrated in Table 23-1) combine to make this an area
fraught with potential for error.
TABLE 23-1 Features contributing to error in the ED setting
Attention to the organization of work, leadership in advocating for patients
and staff in the ED, and open lines of communication in collaborating with
other services are needed to ensure a successful environment for emergency
care. While principles of patient safety discussed in other sections of this
manual apply to the ED, in this chapter, we discuss some areas of patient
safety that are of particular importance to the ED.
CROWDING, BOARDING, AND ITS
EFFECTS
If you were to ask emergency physicians to identify the single biggest threat
to patient safety in the ED, most will tell you that boarding of inpatients and
consequent crowding is by far the biggest concern. In many ways, the ED is
the canary in the coal mine, where problems in the health system first
manifest. One of the biggest challenges and patient safety problems in the
ED is lack of patient flow. For admitted patients, patient flow means the
forward progression of patients from ED presentation and initial evaluation,
to egress from the ED after initial evaluation, management, and
stabilization to a hospital bed. Decreased flow leads to decreased capacity,
ED overcrowding, and numerous patient safety concerns. Figures 23-1 and
23-2 show typical ED arrival pattern by time of the day and by day of the
week. As patients are evaluated as to the severity of their complaints and
conditions, those who have been sorted or “differentiated” and have had
treatment initiated are often less worrisome than the undifferentiated patient
sitting in the waiting room with an occult emergency. Emergency
physicians must necessarily be on the lookout for the next disaster walking
through the door and often lack the time, training, and expertise to perform
ongoing inpatient care simultaneously in the ED. Though boarding of
admitted patients in the ED and consequent crowding have garnered
national attention over the past two decades, there has been little
improvement in conditions.3 The American College of Emergency
Physicians (ACEP) defines a boarding patient as one “who remains in the
ED after they have been admitted to a facility, but has not transferred to that
inpatient unit.” Studies have shown that boarding ED patients results in
poor pain control and decreased patient satisfaction; delays antibiotic
administration; increases waiting times and the number of patients who
leave the ED (from the triage waiting area) prior to being seen by a
provider; increases the frequency of medical errors, the number of sentinel
events, patient mortality, and malpractice claims; and has severe financial
consequences.4–7 While policies related to crowding seem to assume that
the ED has unlimited capacity to expand, the reality is that emergency
physicians must always focus on the undifferentiated patients in the waiting
room who may have occult life-threatening conditions, and so a hall bed in
the treatment area can become a very unsafe place for patients who require
admission, as they may receive suboptimal care. ED physicians and nurses
are specifically trained in their given specialty, and this does not include
long-term care of the ICU or medical/surgical patient. Missed timing of
medication doses and laboratory testing and longer hospital lengths of stay
are associated with boarding in the ED.6,8
Figure 23-1 This graph shows a typical plot of ED volume increasing in the
morning arriving at a peak level around noon. Volume then often remains
steady or continues to increase from noon until around 10 pm.

Figure 23-2 This graph displays a typical ED arrival pattern by day of the
week. Volume increases on Friday and tends to peak on Sunday or Monday
evenings. Volume tends to nadir on Thursday morning.

Successful strategies used by hospitals to address boarding include moving
admitted patients from ED hall spots to inpatient hall spots until beds are
available when the boarding burden hits certain thresholds. Though this
practice has been shown to be safe, resulting in increased turnover of beds
and improved patient satisfaction, and to make financial sense, it is often
underutilized as this is perceived by the hospital and nursing administration
to be unsafe, unacceptable, or unprofitable.3,9 This is often one of the
highest-level interventions that is part of hospital surge protocols that
consist of tiered, transparent, actionable responses tied to specific levels of
ED's crowding. Other strategies have included reorganizing work to a more
patient-centered approach, matching patient demand with availability of
services, including scheduling of elective surgical cases to smooth out the
spikes in bed requirements following surgery to avoid those days where
high surges are predictable and over which a hospital has less control.3
A common response to crowding and boarding has been to increase
capacity by building more beds. Unless processes are improved, however,
increasing the footprint of an ED or the number of beds has been shown to
result in a temporary improvement followed by an even bigger boarding
problem.10 Boarding and overcrowding in the ED can cause a significant
strain to its physical capacity and resources and to personnel time. While
improving flow is the ultimate goal, the focus should not be on working
faster. Instead, efforts need to be on smarter and more efficient functioning
of the hospital and health care systems as a whole. Adequate ED flow is a
precondition for safe and high-quality patient care.
TIME-CRITICAL DIAGNOSES
Care for time-critical conditions is a core mission of emergency medicine.
This task requires a high level of coordination of services to rapidly muster
and intensely apply resources for diagnosis and therapeutic interventions.
Conditions and burdens that threaten the ability to accomplish these tasks,
such as ED crowding, or incentives that distract time-dependent resources
impair this core mission.
In 2005, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) began
publically reporting hospital “core” process of care measures focused on
heart failure, heart attack, pneumonia, and surgical care. Many of these
measures were focused on time-critical diagnoses and treatment. Examples
for acute myocardial infarction (MI) care include aspirin at arrival,
thrombolytics administered within 30 minutes of arrival, or PCI within 90
minutes of arrival. Examples for pneumonia include timing of antibiotics
from arrival and correct choice of antibiotics. An early pneumonia measure
requiring administration of antibiotics within 4 hours of arrival reveals the
potential for perverse incentives in quality measurement. When physicians
and hospitals felt they were being penalized for delayed diagnosis of
pneumonia among patients with vague symptoms diagnosed only after
extensive evaluations, administrators were incentivized to “uptriage” these
patients, potentially at the expense of sicker patients, to administer
antibiotics to patients who did not require them, or to take other actions to
game the system. The unintended consequences of these measures based on
tenuous evidence led to a sustained uproar from the medical community,
and the measures were subsequently modified and ultimately removed.11,12
Other recognized time-critical conditions include severe trauma where a
“golden hour” after injury for successful resuscitation has long been
recognized. More recently, data suggesting benefit of thrombolysis in the
treatment of stroke for patients presenting in the first 3 hours has driven
discussions of regionalization of care and prioritization of these patients on
presentation to achieve the best care and fastest time possible for
reperfusion of brain tissue.
DIAGNOSTIC ERROR
Since the Institute of Medicine (IOM) report, areas such as medication error
and surgical safety have enjoyed increased attention. Though thought to be
one of the largest areas leading to adverse events and waste in the form of
underutilization and overutilization of services, diagnostic error remains a
black box, tending to be much more difficult to identify and prevent than
other areas of patient safety. Consequently, diagnostic error has been a
largely neglected area of patient safety and is considered “the next frontier
of patient safety.”13 Though it is not truly the mission of the ED to make
final diagnoses, but rather to exclude life- and limb-threatening illness,
there are some diagnoses, especially those with time-critical elements, that
should not be missed. Missed diagnoses of fractures and myocardial
infarction are historically among the most common and the most costly
diagnostic errors in emergency medicine, respectively. Many of the
aforementioned conditions conspire to lead to decision making that is
susceptible to common cognitive biases. Though the effectiveness of doing
so remains to be explored, training in emergency medicine includes focus
on debiasing techniques to help avoid common diagnostic errors. These
include routine education about classic mimics for common complaints
including MI masquerading as gastroenteritis, abdominal aortic aneurysm
presenting as flank pain, hip fracture presenting as knee pain, etc. Education
also focuses on avoiding overreliance on viewing test results as a yes/no
binary means to rule out disease but rather viewing these in a Bayesian
framework as increasing or decreasing the probability of disease.
PROCEDURAL SAFETY
The ED is increasingly the setting for many procedures that may have
previously been performed in other settings. This includes procedures such
as placement of central venous catheters, drainage of abscesses, reduction
of fractures and dislocations, aspiration of fluid from joints and cavities,
and IV procedural sedation to facilitate patient comfort and safety. Though,
historically, procedural safety has primarily focused on the operating room,
the volume of bedside procedures bears increased attention to safety in
areas like the ED. While the literature on procedural safety in the ED is
limited, several conceptual models and recommendations have been made
in recent years in other clinical areas, such as in the operating room. Some
of those principles and practices may at least partially apply to an ED
setting.
There are a number of differences between ED-based procedures and
those taking place in the OR. Most procedures taking place in the ED are on
awake, alert patients (if not sedated) with obvious external pathology. While
this may make certain risks, such as wrong-sided procedures, less likely,
other factors, such as patient acuity, suboptimal environmental conditions,
time pressures, and provider variability, increase procedural risk.14 Some
examples include life- or limb-threatening situations, availability of needed
equipment, physical layout, change of shifts for nursing or physician staff,
and the need to perform procedures on patients with potentially full
stomachs.
Many routine ED procedures are low risk in nature (i.e., IV insertion,
laceration repair). However, emergency care requires that providers train to
be proficient in performing infrequent high-risk procedures, such as
cricothyrotomy, thoracotomy, and pericardiocentesis. The age-old teaching
method of “see one, do one, teach one” is no longer an acceptable approach.
Instead, training now should include simulation and clinical competence in
the use of advanced technologies like bedside ultrasound before providers
are allowed to independently perform high-risk procedures. In addition, the
Joint Commission now requires all bedside procedures to use the same
Universal Protocol that is required in the operating room. Specific
suggested interventions that may increase PS in the ED setting include
adoption of clinical protocols and procedural checklists, use of evolving
technology, and team training.14
Unfortunately, there is no “one-size-fits-all” application that has been
specifically designed and can be used for procedural safety in the ED.
Therefore, procedural safety in the ED needs to incorporate a hybrid model
that encompasses specific elements from the World Health Organization
(WHO) Surgical Safety Checklist, the Joint Commission Universal
Protocol, and current conceptual models and recommendations.
STAFF SAFETY
Violence against health care providers in the US continues to escalate each
year. It is reported that 53% of hospital assaults occur in the ED. Recent
studies have shown that 80% of ED staff know at least one staff member
injured by a violent patient in the past 5 years, while 43% reported physical
attacks on staff occur at least once a month in their ED. Over 10% of
hospitals in a recent survey reported weapon threats against staff occurring
each month. Health care workers experience violent workplace assaults four
times higher than the average in other industries. Seventy-five percent of
emergency physicians report being threatened in the past year, and 28%
have reported being assaulted on the job in the past. Despite these figures, it
is well known that ED violence remains significantly underreported. Some
believe that health care workers have come to accept that workplace
violence is just part of the job.
Visits to the ED by patients with behavioral health issues and/or drug-
and alcohol-related illness continue to increase. Violence against health care
workers is more prevalent in environments that see higher-level mental
health and substance abuse illness. Numerous negative effects impact health
care workers who have experienced workplace assaults. These include
posttraumatic stress, fear of their workplace, feelings of helplessness and
guilt, depression, and decreased productivity.
Improving safety begins with education/training, awareness, and
increased hospital support for health care workers. Panic alarms, metal
detectors, and 24-hour security have reduced violence in high-risk health
care settings. Recognizing the signs of impending violence and having the
training/skills to de-escalate the situation are essential. Highly coordinated
rapid teamwork by physicians, nurses, and security has been shown to make
the workplace safer. Aggressive reporting of workplace violence events
along with guidelines on reporting to police and state prosecutors helps
establish a culture of zero tolerance for violence. These measures reduce the
helplessness some health care workers feel in their environment.
Unfortunately, only half the states in the US have strict penalties for
assaults against health care workers.
Workplace violence prevention programs are successful when there is
employee 
involvement 
and 
hospital 
management 
commitment.
Comprehensive programs that include security and health care personnel
safety training along with incident debriefing are important components.
Environments where health care workers feel safe and protected promote
higher quality of care provided to patients, improved morale, and increased
productivity.
TEAMS AND TEAMWORK
When the terms team and teamwork come to mind, most people think about
their favorite baseball or football organization. In the complex environment
of health care, teams and teamwork are essential to providing safe and
optimal patient care. Applying teamwork to clinical practice can prove to be
quite challenging and is still a relatively new concept. And despite it being a
challenge, the health care arena is an excellent venue to form teams as it
already consists of groups of individuals.
How can teams impact ED performance? One must first focus on the
difference between a group and a team. A group can be thought of as a
number of people without a shared focus on certain values, while a team
usually consists of people who have a shared purpose. For the team to be
successful, they have to have a shared understanding of intended goals and
be aware of each team member's roles and responsibilities.15 A typical team
in the ED may consist of the bedside RN, patient care tech, emergency
physician, social worker, case coordinator, and consulting physicians.
While having a team leader is important in the functioning of a team,
the ability to flatten hierarchy is essential for success and to avoid
hazards.16 Empowering front-line staff to speak up when they have a safety
concern can make the difference between high performance and failure.
This kind of culture change can be difficult and requires having all the staff
on board. Data demonstrate that workplaces with higher levels of teamwork
outperform those with lower levels.17,18 Overall, high-functioning medical
teams consist of individuals who have a shared goal and mental model and
work fluidly to provide safe and effective health care.
COMMUNICATION
It may come as no surprise that a significant portion of adverse events and
outcomes in the ED is the direct result of poor communication practices.
This is particularly evident in communication that occurs across transitions
of patient care (i.e., shift changes, admitted patients, speaking with
consultants). Emergency medicine providers are faced with daily challenges
such as frequent interruptions, increased production pressures, and high-
impact decision making that all contribute to challenging communication.
Therefore, it is essential that emergency medicine providers incorporate
communication strategies into their daily practice. Some examples of
communication strategies include using a standardized handoff tool,
protocol, or read back technique.19 Patient safety in the ED can only
improve once an overall awareness of the importance of effective
communication is appreciated.
COORDINATION OF CARE
It is recognized that a minority of superusers drive a disproportionate
amount of costs and resource utilization in health care. According to the
Center for Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP)
Services, 5% of Medicaid beneficiaries account for 54% of the program's
total expenditures and 1% account for 25% of the total.20 A report funded
by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality found that 5% of the
population accounts for 49% of health care spending.21 In addition, among
Medicare patients admitted to the hospital, nearly 20% are readmitted
within 30 days of being discharged, and nearly three-quarters of those
admissions may be preventable.22 Combined with an increasing elderly
population, the prevalence of limited health literacy, a threadbare primary
care network, and a high proportion of uninsured patients, it is more
important than ever that the health system make unprecedented efforts to
coordinate care for patients trying to navigate the fragmented health care
system. This is essential to get patients the right care and timely care and to
keep them out of the hospital and out of the ED. This will involve
participation of hospital departments, third-party payers, community
providers, and patients in sharing information in a community care network.
Recently, a number of initiatives have focused on confirming readiness for
discharge from the hospital, setting up follow-up appointments and home
health and transportation services. A number of EDs have instituted nurse
follow-up call programs, appointment scheduling, and other interventions to
help optimize coordination of care. Providing alternatives for unscheduled
acute care visits including services such as extended primary care physician
office hours, urgent care appointments and home infusion services are
important for helping keep patients healthy and out of the hospital.
DISCHARGING PATIENTS SAFELY
FROM THE ED
Discharge from the ED is increasingly recognized as a high-risk transition
of care with the potential for loss of important information. The prevalence
of limited health literacy among ED patients is high, and print materials for
patients are often written at a higher reading level than that possessed by
many patients. Though providers believe in the effectiveness of techniques
to improve communication, they rarely use them,23 and few verify
confirmation of discharge instructions.24 It is recommended that patients
receive written and verbal communication about their ED visit that explains
in plain language their diagnosis, information about tests and treatment
rendered, home care, medication, follow-up instructions, and reasons to
return to the ED. Comprehension of discharge instructions should be
confirmed asking the patient to repeat back their instructions and receive
clarifying feedback.19 Nearly all patients being discharged from the ED
should be given instructions to make a follow-up appointment with a
primary care provider. Unfortunately, many patients do not have primary
care providers, or follow-up appointments cannot be scheduled for weeks
later. Coordination of care including primary care and unscheduled acute
care options outside the ED are components of the health care safety net
that are badly needed. Lack of outpatient options can lead to worse
outcomes and return ED visits.
KEY POINTS
In summary, emergency medicine is an exciting and mission-critical
area of patient care, but the ED can also be a dangerous place for
patients if structure and processes are not in place to ensure timely,
reliable systems that address problems that arise. This includes:
Attention to the safety and organization of work
Leadership in addressing issues such as boarding and crowding
Clear communication and teamwork in caring for patients with
time-critical diagnoses

CLINICAL VIGNETTE
MT is a 12-year-old boy (weighing 60 kg and 156 cm in length) whose past
medical history is significant for relapsed acute lymphocytic leukemia
(ALL). He was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) with
profound septic shock secondary to Escherichia coli colitis. His ICU course
was complicated by the development of abdominal compartment syndrome,
renal failure, and respiratory failure requiring extended mechanical
ventilation. As he recovered, he was successfully extubated but, due to
narcotic habituation, required initiation of a hydromorphone infusion
delivered by a computerized ambulatory drug delivery (CADD) pump. On
the evening of the event, he was exhibiting signs of agitation and
discomfort. An order was entered in the computer to administer a 0.016
mg/kg bolus of intravenous hydromorphone; he was inadvertently given a
0.16 mg/kg dose. Thirty minutes later, the dosing error was recognized
when he was noted to be hypopneic, with pinpoint pupils and increasing
lethargy. He was treated with naloxone with subsequent improvement in his
symptomatology, and the hydromorphone infusion was restarted 3 hours
later without incident. The dosing error was disclosed to the family who
expressed their understanding of the circumstances and the plan. The order
was reviewed and was written correctly in the computerized order entry
system.

INTRODUCTION
Children are not little adults. This fact poses unique challenges regarding
patient safety and quality in pediatrics. Rates of medical errors are similar
in adults and children, but the potential for adverse drug events within the
pediatric inpatient population is approximately three times higher than in
hospitalized adults.3
UNIQUE 
SAFETY 
ISSUES 
IN
PEDIATRICS
The increased vulnerability of children in the health care setting has been
attributed to several factors.4
Many health care settings are structured for the care of adult patients
and lack trained staff oriented to pediatric care, protocols and
safeguards, and up-to-date and easily accessible pediatric equipment
and reference materials such as drug dosing manuals, vital sign ranges,
and textbooks of common physical findings. Emergency departments
may be particularly risk-prone environments for children.5
Younger children are less capable of communicating adverse effects
they may be experiencing.
Children have less mature hepatic, renal, and immune systems and are
more prone to experience the physiologic adverse effects of
medication errors.
Most commercially available medications are prepared and packaged
for adults. These medications often then have to be prepared in
different volumes and concentrations prior to administration to
pediatric patients. The need to alter the original medication
formulation and/or dose requires a series of pediatric-specific
calculations and tasks, each significantly increasing the possibility of
error.
TECHNOLOGY IN PEDIATRICS
In response to the 1999 Institute of Medicine Report and leading health care
initiatives, many hospitals began implementing various available
technologies to improve patient safety. These technologies included
innovations such as computerized order entry, “smart” infusion pumps, and
bar coding devices. While all designed to minimize errors, each had
potential to introduce unanticipated outcomes. For example, the
introduction of computerized order entry at a major children's hospital was
designed to decrease errors related to dosing and illegible handwriting but
was paradoxically associated with an increase in mortality.6 Smart infusion
pumps have been shown to decrease the number of errors in the pediatric
population1; however, the incidence of serious medication events was
unchanged with the use of that same technology in another study.7 Bar
coding and positive patient identification also has promise in the prevention
of wrong-patient medication administration and laboratory sampling;
however, research has demonstrated conflicting results as to its
effectiveness. In neonates, a 47% reduction in adverse drug events has been
demonstrated,8 although these data have not been replicated in children or
adults.
Of particular concern with all technology is the “work-around”
phenomenon as these devices may increase a provider's workload. For
example, “charting by exception” is a shortcut whereby a bedside provider
transfers prior chart values in a time-saving maneuver. Caregivers may also
find ways to decrease the time it takes to enter medications, for example, by
removing identifying labels, combining them, and scanning them at one
time. If work-arounds are discovered, a key component of improving the
culture of safety is to listen to the frontline providers as to why such actions
were necessary. Resources such as unit safety committees and hospital
quality oversight committees can be useful in commissioning debriefing
events and analyses to identify practical solutions that improve care
delivery.
While technology is important in enhancing systems, programs
designed to hone assessment skills are also important in the care of the
child, particularly those who are unable to communicate secondary to either
developmental milestones or medical fragility. Pediatric Early Warning
Systems have been developed and validated, which use objective criteria
from a patient's neurobehavioral status, cardiovascular system, and
respiratory parameters to generate a score that indicates a need for increased
monitoring or escalation of care.9,10 The Institute of Healthcare
Improvement has also advocated rapid response teams; data in both
children and adults have been inconclusive as to improved outcomes.
However, rapid response teams represent good clinical practice and
promote a culture of safety, particularly among trainees and personnel with
less experience.
COMMUNICATION 
WITH
PARENTS AND FAMILIES
Family-Centered Care
Children are frequently unable to speak for themselves, and as such, their
parents and caregivers are acting not only as advocates but also as decision
makers. Parents (and guardians, including grandparents) provide unique
understanding to a child; for children who are in frequent interaction with
the health care environment, this information is essential. The American
Academy of Pediatrics has established guidelines and recommendations
regarding the concept of family-centered care. Familial presence at bedside
rounds should be considered standard practice, and parents should be
offered the opportunity to be present during procedures.11 A typical concern
is the impact such a structure has on both families and trainees. When
studied, most parents responded that attendance at rounds reduced their
concerns and increased their confidence in the health care team; medical
trainees were less likely to support this and believed that care and learning
opportunities were blunted when families were present.12
Consent, Permission, and Assent
A key aspect in the care of children is the relationship between physicians,
patients, and families in the decision-making process, not only in medical
care but also in the research arena. The concepts of parental permission and
patient assent are adjuncts to the tenet of informed consent. The
responsibility for informed consent in children is frequently assumed by a
parent or guardian, which, although rare, may prove problematic when the
adult's beliefs are incongruent with the best interest of the child. Parental
permission is the notion that decisions regarding the care of a young child
involve a common responsibility between practitioners and families. Patient
assent involves the concept that children who have reached an age of
understanding should be included in the discussions surrounding care or
research protocols.13
MEDICATION SAFETY
Medication errors are one of the most frequent adverse events that occur in
health care settings. Pediatric patients are at higher risk of error as
compared to adults, with increased potential for harm.14 The true incidence
of medication errors is unknown as this is dependent upon accurate
reporting; using a trigger tool, there was an average of 11.1% rate of
adverse drug events in pediatric patients.15 A study published in 2003 aimed
at characterizing medication errors in pediatrics concluded that the majority
of errors occurred at the ordering stage. Potentially harmful errors were
more likely to involve errors in dosing, allergies, or frequency.16 A recent
study in an academic, university-affiliated hospital found that 10-fold
medication errors were a significant source of risk to pediatric patients.
Morphine was the most frequently error-reported medication, and opioids
were the most frequently reported drug class. Intravenous formulations,
paper ordering, and drug delivery pumps were frequent error enablers.
Errors of dose calculation, documentation of decimal points, and confusion
with zeroes were frequent contributing causes to 10-fold medication
errors.17
There are numerous reasons that the pediatric patient is more
susceptible to medication errors. In contrast to most medications used in
adults, pediatric dosages are calculated based upon their weight, introducing
an extra step where an error may occur. Additionally, pediatric doses are
calculated in the metric system; most parents and patients in the US are
familiar with body weight measured in pounds, not kilograms. Depending
upon the size of the patient, doses may contain decimal points, which
predisposes a patient to a potential dosing error by a factor of 10. To
minimize this risk, the Joint Commission recommends using a leading zero
in front of the decimal point and never using a trailing zero after the
decimal point.14 Another source of dosing errors in pediatrics is a failure to
recognize the adult dose of a medication. Many pediatricians and pediatric
trainees know the weight-based dose for specific medications; however, for
an older child or adolescent patient, this dose may be higher than the adult
dose.
Another pediatric medication challenge is the commercially available
dosage preparation. Solid oral dosage forms, such as tablets and capsules,
are not typically the correct dose needed for a child. Even if the dose is
correct, infants, toddlers, and children cannot swallow tablets and capsules.
Availability of liquid preparations may be limited, particularly in remote
areas, compounding pharmacies face challenges in maintaining stability of
liquid preparations, and data on how to prepare the compounds may be
unavailable. In addition, intravenous medications are not packaged with the
pediatric patient in mind. Frequently, available concentrations are often not
conducive for use in the pediatrics, and the drugs must first be diluted to
obtain the correct dose. Also, manufacturers may recommend that the adult
dose be place into a certain volume (i.e., 100 mL) for administration. In
neonates and children with congenital or acquired heart disease, this volume
could lead to fluid overload. It is recommended that medications for
pediatric patients be made as a standard concentration to reduce the
likelihood of a dilution or calculation error and with as few concentrations
as possible.4
A final challenge in the safe use of medications in the pediatric patient
is the lack of drug studies in this population. Most medications are
developed, tested, and approved for adult use. Once the drug is approved,
the medication can be used off-label for other indications, including use in
pediatric patients. Along with the challenge of the dosing formulations
already discussed, if the medication is thought to be beneficial in a pediatric
patient, determining the correct dose can be problematic. Depending upon
the age of the patient, children have different pharmacokinetic parameters
as compared to adults. This may affect the volume of distribution,
metabolism, clearance, and overall exposure to the medication. This also
changes throughout the stages of development; therefore, there is a need to
study the medications in all pediatric age ranges. The development of “gray
baby syndrome” with chloramphenicol and kernicterus with sulfa
medications are examples of adverse drug reactions, which can occur in
neonates, due to their age-related pharmacokinetic differences. New
medications need to be studied in the pediatric patient to determine safety
and efficacy; caution should be used when initiating a medication that has
not been thoroughly studied in pediatrics.
A summary of recommendations to minimize pediatric medication
errors is highlighted in Tables 24-1 through 24-3.

CLINICAL VIGNETTE
A portable chest radiograph was obtained to assess causes for poor
oxygenation in a patient admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU). The
image was reversed when loading it into the hospital's picture archiving and
communication system (PACS). Distorted anatomy allowed the error to
escape detection during the initial image interpretation. As a result, the
patient's new pneumothorax was interpreted as being on the left instead of
the right. The ICU team was promptly notified of a new left pneumothorax,
and the error was not detected until after a chest tube had been placed.
INTRODUCTION
Imaging has become an indispensable tool for modern health care since it
frequently supplements the medical history and laboratory evaluation.
Imaging not only has reduced the need for invasive procedure but also is
being used to guide an increasing number of minimally invasive
procedures. These advances have led to faster diagnosis, treatment, and
recovery. The drawback is a complex and segmented system where key
steps such as selection of the most appropriate imaging study, image
acquisition, study interpretation, and treatment decisions are distributed
across different individuals and teams.1 Such complexity and segmentation
can degrade system performance unless reliability concepts such as checks,
redundancies, and error recovery strategies are added. High-reliability
organizations recognize that errors can and will occur at any step.2 Ensuring
safe, high-quality medical imaging requires a systematic assessment of
multiple processes.
SYSTEMATIC 
APPROACH 
TO
MEDICAL IMAGING
The steps necessary for imaging to add value have been compared to the
Five Rights of Medication Administration. The ideal imaging system
includes five steps: Right Study, Right Order, Right Way, Right Report, and
Right Action. This process starts with a clinical question. Data are collected
and analyzed to answer the question. The results are then used to drive
treatment decisions. In this process, information is also available from other
sources such as history, physical examination, laboratory evaluation, and
prior encounters. The information from these sources can assist with
choosing the most appropriate imaging study or focusing on the most likely
diagnosis. In some cases, information from these sources can completely
obviate the need for an imaging study. Given the risks, delays, and costs of
gathering data, the ideal system will only collect enough data to answer the
question at hand.3 One should avoid situations where data are collected to
satisfy one's curiosity or confirm an established diagnosis. In this ideal
system, data-gathering activities are tightly linked to treatment decisions.
The Right Study
Choosing the right study begins with determining if imaging is the best
source of the information and ends with choosing a particular imaging
study. Regrettably, evidence-based decision guidelines for imaging have
only been developed a few scenarios.4 Observation versus head CT for
children with minor head trauma is a well-studied example. A recent large
study confirmed that when certain criteria are met, the pretest probability of
discovering a clinically important finding with head CT is extremely low.5
Unless continued observation over the next few hours reveals new
information, the child's parents should be informed that the available data
set predicts a complete recovery. From the perspective of information
theory,6 the additional data provided by the head CT are redundant. Still,
many anxious parents will often ask about getting a head CT “just to be
sure.” However, in settings where the pretest probability of a serious injury
is extremely low, the risks of the ionizing radiation as well as risks of
falsely positive or negative studies should be part of the decision-making
process.1 Any result other than “normal” undermines the reassurance that
parents experience when hearing the results. In addition, the benefit of any
abnormal diagnostic study is linked to the health system's ability to act on
the result and promote recovery. Indeed, some have suggested that not
knowing about a potentially serious condition such as prostate cancer has
benefits because the treatment can be worse than the disease.7 Failure
modes for selecting the right study are found in Table 25-1.
TABLE 
25-1 
Right 
Study
This Bayesian approach to medical decision making requires frontline
teams to look for patterns in the available data before determining whether
an imaging study will add value to the existing data set. In many cases, time
and energy spent collecting additional history, prior imaging exams, and
laboratory results will better address diagnostic uncertainty and guide
therapeutic interventions than an additional imaging study. The importance
of obtaining and reviewing prior imaging exams cannot be overemphasized.
“The Right Study” is often the one that was performed last week in a
physician's office or an hour ago in the outside hospital. While most of the
data embedded in electronic medical records cannot be shared between
facilities, medical imaging utilizes a standardized format (DICOM) that
allows gigabytes of information to be quickly and reliably conveyed to the
point of care. Information systems can clearly improve their ability to
support frontline teams by leveraging the ever-increasing amount of data
captured in electronic formats.
Once the decision is made that a new imaging study is needed to guide
care, the question becomes, which study among the numerous imaging
choices is “the Right Study”? This problem can be compared to a common
navigation problem. One typically relies on personal experience when
navigating from point A to B, but when personal experience is lacking,
navigation aids become critical. Imaging professionals often serve as guides
who plot a course using their knowledge of the terrain and the traveler's
desired destination. The decision-making algorithms used by these guides
are increasingly being incorporated into computerized systems. In the same
way that GPS navigation systems not only help plot the route but also
update the guidance information as the trip unfolds, clinical decision
support systems can use information about the patient's current condition
and goals of therapy to update their recommendations. The ever-increasing
array of diagnostic studies such as ultrasound, CT, magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET) can be
considered different waypoints along a route that leads to treatment and
recovery. While consultation with an imaging expert may still be needed to
discern the best path through a unique clinical situation, the 80/20 rule
suggests that the 80% of imaging decisions follow a relatively limited
number of paths. Automated decision support tools promise to help
frontline teams find these optimal paths in common situations with 24/7
availability.
The Right Order
Orders for imaging studies frequently fail to convey the necessary
information (Table 25-2). These orders should receive the same diligence
that is being used to ensure accuracy with medication orders. Although no
reasonable provider would submit an order of “antibiotic for pneumonia,”
vague orders for imaging studies such as “brain scan to rule out pathology”
remain all too common. As orders for imaging studies become more
specific, imaging departments work to reconcile the study order with the
most appropriate study. A common example is chest CT where studies are
frequently ordered without and with intravenous contrast. Such dual or
combination studies are very rarely needed, but there is a natural human
tendency to believe that “more is better.”
TABLE 
25-2 
Right 
Order
Choosing the most appropriate exam includes communicating the site and
nature of the clinical concern. Foot radiographs are often ordered for
evaluation of ankle injuries, and the site of maximal tenderness is often
absent from the request. While these errors are often corrected by the
technologist performing the exam, it requires additional work to contact the
ordering provider, cancel the existing exam, and order the correct study.
Multiple exams are often concurrently requested to address the same
clinical question. A more reasonable strategy would be to select the most
appropriate study first and evaluate that result before proceeding to the next
study. While the shotgun approach might occasionally seem more efficient,
it is akin to prescribing multiple drugs for same symptom in hope that one
is effective. Although some may contend that multiple antibiotics are often
given concurrently when the organism causing a serious infection is
uncertain, the difference is that while multiple antibiotics can be given
concurrently, it is usually not possible to simultaneously perform multiple
imaging studies. Thus, one must decide upon a sequence of imaging studies,
typically balancing diagnostic yield versus access, invasiveness, and cost.
The Right Way
The imaging department typically controls whether the study is performed
in “the Right Way,” and selected failure modes are found in Table 25-3.
Choices start with selecting the “right” equipment and settings to maximize
the probability of answering the clinical question while minimizing risk.
While the details of this optimization process are beyond the scope of this
chapter, one good example occurs when imaging children.
TABLE 
25-3 
Right 
Way
Most imaging equipment has been designed to serve the much larger adult
market. As a result, the imaging equipment even in pediatric specialty
centers is identical or nearly identical to that used to image adults.
However, the marked differences in patient size between newborns,
toddlers, and teenagers have prompted pediatric specialty centers to develop
size-specific imaging protocols.9 In the same way that doses of medications
are adjusted for the child's weight, machine settings for pediatric imaging
should be adjusted for the patient's size. This is particular important for CT
scans and radiographs since x-ray penetration drops geometrically as body
part diameter increases. The amount of ionizing radiation needed to
adequately image a 15-cm thick abdomen is typically one-tenth that needed
to image a 30-cm thick abdomen.
The “right way” for imaging studies includes making the most
informative images accessible to everyone treating the patient. While it
might seem ideal to make the entire study immediately available, network
bandwidth issues arise when trying to share imaging studies that exceed a
gigabyte. Further, locating the key images within studies that consist of
several hundred images takes time. To preserve bandwidth, decrease storage
costs, and improve physician workflow, a subset of the entire study is often
uploaded to the picture archiving and communication system (PACS).
PACS is also used to identify prior studies and make them available for
comparison.
The Right Report
Radiologists play a central role in the acquisition and interpretation of most
imaging studies. They review large amounts of imaging data and
summarize the key findings in a report that ideally concludes by addressing
the clinical question. Image interpretation can be considered a type of data
compression where gigabytes of imaging data are distilled into kilobytes of
text. High levels of compression occur when imaging data can be succinctly
described as “normal” or “unchanged from the prior study.” Abnormalities
and interval changes in the imaging data can usually be summarized by
referring to the responsible pathophysiology and pertinent details, for
example, “5.0-cm diverticular abscess in the left lower quadrant.” Multiple
failure modes undermine efforts to generate the Right Report (Table 25-4).
TABLE 
25-4 
Right 
Report
Images from prior studies should be reviewed as part of interpreting the
current exam. Pathophysiology is a dynamic process and often the question
is not whether disease is present but whether it is responding to treatment.
Such assessments are impossible without prior studies. Prior studies from
the same institution are readily retrieved from an institution's PACS.
Subspecialty care and second opinions are increasingly prompting patients
to bring their prior imaging studies on compact discs. Many sites now load
these outside studies into their PACS so that they can be compared to prior
or subsequent studies. More advanced solutions are being developed to
facilitate rapid transfer of imaging information across great distances.10
Image interpretation begins with focusing visual attention. Both
attention and the subsequent perception of patterns are heavily influenced
by expectations at the conscious and subconscious levels. The common
adage is that “you only see what you know.” When multiple abnormalities
are present, the detection of each depends on completing an exhaustive
search. The satisfaction of search phenomena describes premature
termination of the search since finding several abnormalities early in the
search pattern can cause attention to shift to interpretation rather than
completing the search.11
Once patterns are detected, image interpretation then progresses to
pattern characterization. Findings are categorized as normal or abnormal
although normal variants and incidental findings create substantial latitude
for categorization. Pattern analysis leads to a differential diagnosis.
Decisions are then made regarding where each possibility is placed in this
list. Ideally, the most likely entity is placed at the top of the list, and the list
only contains reasonable possibilities. Generating exhaustive lists of ten or
more possible diagnoses might improve diagnostic sensitivity but at the
expense of specificity.
Time-sensitive, critical findings warrant immediate attention and trigger
notification of the primary team. Unfortunately, notification of critical
findings is impeded by multiple failure modes. The image interpreter and
primary team might have different definitions of what constitutes a “time-
sensitive, critical finding.” While all might agree that tension pneumothorax
and ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm warrant immediate notification,
disagreements occur with pulmonary nodules and similar abnormalities.
Deciding whether the abnormality is clinically important requires insight
into the mental model of the primary team.12 Again, the radiologist must try
to balance sensitivity and specificity. An overly sensitive trigger might lead
to contacting the primary team for every abnormality. Conversely, setting
the trigger threshold too high will almost certainly lead to complaints such
as “I should have been called about this report.” While critical notification
of lab results is triggered by comparing results to an objective threshold, the
process is far more subjective for imaging studies.
The ideal radiology report is accurate, timely, succinct, complete, and
easily to comprehend and includes ancillary information such as technique,
radiation exposure, and notes as to who was notified and when notification
occurred. The report might also include annotated copies of key images.
The report is distributed to requesting teams and a copy is archived.
The Right Action
The final step in this sequence is using the imaging information to impact
patient care. The Right Action means that the care provider receives the
information, reviews it, understands it, and takes appropriate action in a
timely manner. Numerous failure modes can undermine this step (Table 25-
5). Many patients have multiple physicians, and it is not uncommon that
some but not all of the patient's physicians receive a copy of the report.
Even with electronic systems where all reports are available, the signal can
be lost due to alert fatigue or lack of clarity as to which physician is
responsible for reviewing the results and taking action. Indeed, one
unintended consequence of critical result notification is that some teams
have developed the expectation that they will be called about any important
result.
TABLE 
25-5 
Right 
Action
Communication breakdowns can cause a failure to understand the
implications of the radiology report. A common example is the lack of a
shared mental model for both the message's sender and receiver. The report
might describe severe pancreatitis with lack of enhancement in the
pancreatic body and tail, but the primary team might not recognize this as a
description of necrotizing pancreatitis or fully understand the implications
of that diagnosis.
Even in cases where the diagnosis is understood, failure to take
appropriate action occurs. This includes meaning to act but being
interrupted during the process and then forgetting to resume a planned
sequence. It also occurs when a slip or lapse occurs during an intended
action.
Quality and Safety Issues in Radiology
Exposing Patients to Ionizing Radiation
TABLE 25-6 Estimated Radiation Dose for Common Proceduresa
aThe effective doses will vary widely between patients and institutions.13 Even greater variation
occurs with fluoroscopic procedures such as coronary angiography and TIPS.
With exception of ultrasound and MRI studies, medical imaging requires
exposing patients to ionizing radiation (Table 25-6). Ionizing radiation is in
the form of x-rays for radiographs, CT exams, and fluoroscopic procedures.
For nuclear medicine studies, the ionizing radiation includes γ rays and
emission of charged particles. Ionizing radiation damages biologic tissue
predominantly by causing double-strand breaks in DNA molecules.14 In
some cases, the DNA damage leads to immediate cell death, but in others, it
induces a mutation, which is passed to the cell's progeny. Since cancer
induction is linked to DNA mutations, ionizing radiation is classified as a
carcinogen.15 Ionizing radiation should be viewed as a drug with a narrow
therapeutic window. Underuse of radiation increases the likelihood of a
treatment failure due to a paucity of diagnostic information. Overuse of
radiation does not improve diagnostic accuracy but does increase the
probability of side effects such as skin injury and future neoplasms.
The linkage between ionizing radiation exposure and cancer induction
is well accepted with high-level exposures, but there is considerable
controversy about the risks of low-level exposure. The best available
evidence points to a linear no-threshold model where the future cancer risk
attributable to radiation exposure increases equally with each increment in
exposure (Fig. 25-1). The current models also predict that risks do not
dissipate with time.
Figure 25-1 Risk models for radiation-induced cancer. Data from Japanese
atomic bomb survivors are indicated by solid line and the gray box. Below
100 mSv, the data are less clear, and while the linear no-threshold model (B,
long dashed line) is currently favored by the National Academy of
Sciences,14 at least three other models (A, C, and D) have been proposed. In
model A, low doses are considered more carcinogenic. In model C, a
threshold is proposed. In model D, low doses are considered protective
since they trigger upregulation of DNA repair mechanisms. Essentially, all
diagnostic procedures and almost all interventional procedures have doses
<100 mSv.
Different units are used to express radiation exposure and its relative risks.
Exposure is expressed using milligray (mGy) where the mGy is measure of
how much energy was deposited in tissue. Given that different tissues vary
in their likelihood of developing cancer, a different unit, the millisievert
(mSv) is used to estimate the probability of cancer induction. Stated another
way, exposure to ionizing radiation is measured in mGy and the result used
to estimate the probability of a biologic impact using mSv. As shown in
Figure 25-2, for any given exposure, the probability of future cancer
induction is substantially higher in neonates than their grandparents.
Figure 25-2 Children are a particularly vulnerable population because they
are far more sensitive to the detrimental effects of ionizing radiation. The
risks of developing cancer after exposure to ionizing radiation have been
repeatedly estimated. The most recent report by the National Academy of
Sciences Committee to Assess Health Risks from Exposure to Low Levels
of Ionizing Radiation provided these estimates.14 The risks of germline
mutations that are passed to future generations and the risks of radiation-
induced organ dysfunction are in addition to these estimated cancer risks.
The risk of future cancer induction is generally estimated as 1 in 1000 for a
10-mSv exposure, and the delay between radiation exposure and cancer
induction is measured in decades. The assessment of these long-delayed
risks is further compounded by the inability to differentiate between cancers
caused by radiation exposure and any other cause. The risks of medical
exposure to ionizing radiation must be considered in the context of radiation
exposure from natural sources and the baseline lifetime probability of
developing cancer. We are exposed to natural sources of ionizing radiation
every day of our lives. A large portion of the exposure results from decay of
naturally occurring isotopes such as radon and potassium. Exposure to
cosmic radiation varies depending on altitude. The result is a baseline
annual exposure of approximately 3 mSv from natural sources. While low
radiation exposure is ubiquitous, cancer is also prevalent. The lifetime risk
of developing cancer is estimated at 30% or more. While medical imaging
has led to a rapid and sizable increase in per capita exposure (Fig. 25-3),
any small increase in cancer rate will be difficult to detect.
Figure 25-3 Trends in US per capita exposure to ionizing radiation. Before
1970, the predominant source of ionizing radiation was from natural
sources, but since then, there has been a rapid increase in medical imaging
that has doubled the per capita exposure. CT is the largest contributor due to
the marked increase in the number of CT studies and the substantial
radiation dose needed to create the 10–300 images in a typical CT study.
Increases in nuclear medicine studies and fluoroscopic interventions have
also played a role.

studies in the United States and worldwide: frequency, radiation dose, and comparison with other
radiation sources—1950–2007. Radiology. 2009;253(2):520–31, Ref. 16.)
MRI Safety
The high magnetic field used for MRI creates a hazardous environment.
The magnetic field is present even when the scanner is not acquiring
imaging. It can interfere with pacemakers, IV pumps, and other electronic
devices. It can also transform metallic objects into projectiles. Patients and
personnel must be screened before they can safely enter this environment.
Resuscitation events (codes) are a particularly dangerous situation since
unscreened personnel often rush into the room in an attempt to rescue the
patient. The resulting tragedies prompted the Joint Commission to
recommend that resuscitation never be attempted in the MRI room.17
The strong radiofrequency gradients needed for MRI can also induce
currents in electrical cables and metal objects. In some cases, the resulting
heating has caused skin burns. The liquid nitrogen and helium used to cool
magnets to low temperatures needed for superconductivity are another
hazard. Serious injuries have occurred because inadequate ventilation led to
accumulation and suffocation due to displacement of oxygen.
Image-Guided Procedures
Imaging is being used to perform an increasing number of procedures. This
includes ultrasound-guided procedures, such as central venous access, CT-
guided biopsies, and fluoroscopic procedures, such as vascular
interventions. In each case, images are being used to help the operator guide
long, slender tools (needles and/or catheters) toward specific targets while
avoiding obstacles. The visual information creates a feedback loop where
course and distance to target and location of intervening obstacles are
transmitted back to the operator.
Fluoroscopic procedures provide a clear example of how low-quality
images contain sufficient information to guide intraprocedural decisions.
While each fluoroscopy frame is typically acquired with 20- to 100-fold
less radiation than its corresponding diagnostic x-ray image, the human
visual system is still able to process these low signal-to-noise images and
recognize key patterns (Fig. 25-4).
Figure 25-4 Demonstration of the sigmoidal relationship between
diagnostic accuracy and image resolution.3 At low resolutions, few
observers would correctly recognize the image as the earth appearing above
the lunar surface. While highest resolution images may be more visually
appealing, once above a certain level, additional data do not improve
diagnostic accuracy.
The ionizing radiation used for fluoroscopic procedures creates a situation
where the operators have a vested interest in patient safety. Their radiation
dose is linked to patient exposure. This linkage prompts the operator to
continually strive to minimize the amount of fluoroscopic information
needed to successfully complete the procedure. Since these procedures
frequently occur outside of radiology, steps, which can reduce patient and
operator dose, are briefly reviewed here.
The simplest method of reducing dose is to reduce the number of
images. For dynamic procedures, this typically means reducing the frame
rate. While fluoroscopy frame rates of 30 frames per second may be needed
in situations with rapid motion, many fluoroscopy units are capable of
pulsed fluoroscopy at 7.5 frames per second or less. This reduction in
temporal resolution provides a fourfold reduction in operator and patient
dose.
Multiple methods will reduce the dose per image. Images can be
acquired with lower signal-to-noise ratios (Fig. 25-4). Operators should
strive to reduce the distance between the patient and the image detector
(Fig. 25-5). Since attenuation increases geometrically with object diameter,
the oblique and lateral images of the abdomen tend to have doses/images 2-
to 10-fold higher than anteroposterior images (Fig. 25-5).
Figure 25-5 Dose considerations for different C-arm geometries during
fluoroscopic procedures. Configuration (A) minimizes dose to the patient
and the team performing the procedure. In this configuration, the scatter is
highest below the table. In (B), the distance between the patient and the
detector leads to a higher dose. In (C), the dose increases because it must
penetrate more tissue before reaching the detector.
The teams performing these procedures can reduce their exposure by
increasing the distance between them and the patient. The operator's dose
primarily results from photons, which are scattered from the patient, and the
highest dose is usually found on the same side as the x-ray generator
(inferior to the table in Fig. 25-5A).
Complex fluoroscopic procedure in the thicker portions of large patients
can lead to substantial skin doses. Skin injuries ranging from transient
erythema to full-thickness necrosis occur but are largely preventable
through a combination of awareness and dose management.18,19 Since the
x-ray beam is attenuated as it passes through tissue, these injuries occur on
the skin closest to the x-ray generator and typically have a shape (circular or
rectangular) that matches the field of view.
RADIOLOGY CONSULTATION
Advances in imaging techniques have made the ordering of imaging studies
a complex process, as studies are commonly tailored to answer a specific
clinical question. For example, the settings used to perform a CT scan of the
chest vary depending on whether the region of interest is the coronary
arteries, great vessels, tracheobronchial tree, or pulmonary parenchyma.
Requesting a “CT scan of the chest” is akin to referring the patient to a
specialist with a history of “chest problem.” Ideally, radiology should be
viewed as any other consultant service, where the consultant is asked to
evaluate the patient and is supplied with the pertinent data. For radiology,
this includes formal requests for consultation that are entered into the
medical record or calls/visits to the reading room.
KEY POINTS
1. Imaging is a complex, multistep process. Numerous factors can
degrade system performance.
2. The ionizing radiation used for CT scans, radiographs, fluoroscopic
procedures, and nuclear medicine studies carries risks of cancer
induction and skin injuries. In most cases, the benefits of these
imaging studies greatly exceed their risks. However, radiation
should be viewed as a high-hazard medication with a narrow
therapeutic window.
3. While MRI avoids the risks associated with ionizing radiation, the
strong magnetic fields and radiofrequency energy needed to
create these images create a hazardous environment. Patients and
personnel must be screened for metallic implants, pacemakers,
and other items not suited to high magnetic fields before entering
this environment.

26 Patient Safety and Quality in
Ambulatory Care
Emily Fondahn and Michael Lane
CLINICAL VIGNETTE
Ms. R is a 45-year-old woman who presented to her primary care physician
(PCP) for her yearly physical examination. She pointed out a new mole on
her right arm and on her right thigh to her PCP and was referred to a local
dermatologist. At the dermatologist's office, she had a biopsy performed of
both moles. After 2 weeks, she called the dermatology office for her test
results and was told that the lesion was benign. The following year, she
returned to her PCP for her yearly exam. Her PCP shared the same EMR as
the dermatologist and discovered that the lesion on her right arm was
melanoma and the lesion on her right thigh was benign. Later, it was
discovered that the pathology report for the right arm lesion was
accidentally misfiled, so the nurse only reported the results of the benign
lesion.
What are some key differences between patient safety for inpatients
and outpatients?
What are the most common types of errors in the outpatient setting?
What methods are used to decrease the risk for failing to communicate
results to patients?
INTRODUCTION
The majority of patient safety and quality research has focused on the
inpatient setting, leaving a lack of intervention-based research in patient
safety and quality for the ambulatory setting. There were an estimated 1.1
billion ambulatory visits in the US in 2010 with this number expecting to
rise due to the shift from inpatient to outpatient care and the aging
population.1 Given these numbers, the potential harm in outpatient
medicine is immense. According to the Colorado and Utah Medical
Practices Study, an estimated 75,000 hospitalizations per year are due to
preventable adverse events in the ambulatory setting. The most common
types of ambulatory adverse events were medication events, surgical events,
or diagnostic adverse events.2 Safety and quality principles, such as just
culture, infection prevention, event identification and analysis, and
communication and medication safety, have been researched for inpatients
and can be modified for the outpatient setting. On the other hand,
differences between caring for inpatients and outpatients can make other
safety methodology less relevant (Table 26-1).
TABLE 26-1 Differences between Inpatient and Outpatient Care
Outpatient care encompasses a wide variety of patients, acuity of care, and
health care settings. Outpatient practices can range from a single provider to
a large, multispecialty group, with or without hospital affiliation. Given the
variety of outpatient settings, there is likewise a wide range of quality and
safety programs and initiatives.
Types of outpatient settings
1. Physician practices and clinics 2. Ambulatory surgery centers 3. Urgent
care facilities
4. Emergency departments
5. Dialysis centers
6. Imaging centers
7. Oncology centers
8. Endoscopy centers
9. Rehabilitation centers
10. Sleep centers
Multiple barriers exist for initiation and sustainment of quality and safety
programs in the outpatient setting. Within a large medical group, there can
be a wide range of management policies, resources, and electronic health
record use, especially if the medical group is a merger of multiple smaller,
relatively independent practices. Hospital-affiliated centers may have safety
and quality resources provided by the hospital. Smaller practices may have
more difficulty obtaining and maintaining quality measurements due to
financial and personnel constraints.3 Team members, including the
physicians, may not have sufficient training or protected time for safety and
quality work. Additionally, with the advent of hospitalists, many primary
care providers do not see patients in the inpatient setting resulting in
decreased interaction with other providers and increasing isolation.
However, given the increasing amount of care provided in the ambulatory
setting, these barriers need to be addressed to improve patient care.
In the inpatient setting, medical care is delivered by a multidisciplinary
team including physicians, nurses, respiratory therapists, and physical and
occupational therapists, allowing for coordination of all care aspects. In the
outpatient setting, the individual patients are often responsible for
coordinating the majority of their health care without the same level of
support; the burden of care is on the patient and his or her outpatient
caregivers (family, friends, etc.). Poor patient outcomes and adverse events
can occur due to the patient's increased accountability for managing his or
her own health and making treatment decisions. For example, patients with
congestive heart failure will make numerous decisions to guide their health
every day, such as taking their medications as prescribed, eating a low-salt
diet, regularly weighing themselves, and calling their health care provider
with worsening symptoms. However, if patients do not follow or understand
their care instructions, they may be at increased risk for worsening disease
and a poor outcome.
PATIENT 
SAFETY 
IN
AMBULATORY CARE
Outpatient care may also be viewed as safer given the lower acuity of
illness in healthier patients. However, patient harm can and still does occur.
Errors are frequently not reported in the ambulatory setting. Outpatient
visits outnumber hospital discharges by more than 30–1. On average, an
individual will have approximately 4 visits to an ambulatory care center
each year; however, only approximately 10% of Americans will have an
inpatient stay in a given year.1 Despite the fact that the vast majority of
medical care is delivered in the ambulatory setting, only 4.1% of sentinel
events reported to the Joint Commission occurred in the ambulatory
setting.4 Error reporting is difficult in the ambulatory setting due to short
patient interactions, multiple providers in different settings, lack of
consensus about error definitions, and lack of ambulatory error reporting
systems.5 Improved classification of outpatient errors can help create
categories for future study.6 In 2011, the American Medical Association
(AMA) published a 10-year review entitled “Research in the Ambulatory
Patient Safety,” which identified the top six errors made in the ambulatory
setting and current gaps in research.7 The top six errors identified include
the following:
Medication errors
Diagnostic errors
Laboratory errors
Clinical knowledge errors
Communication errors
Administrative errors
Understanding these errors helps teach us when to recognize an error when
it occurs and prevent future errors. Some of these topics are covered in
more detail in other chapters (Medication Safety, Diagnostic Errors).
MEDICATION ERRORS
Medication errors are very common in the outpatient setting. This section
highlights some of the unique difficulties with medication safety for the
ambulatory setting. In the inpatient setting, physicians can generally assume
that the patient is receiving what is listed on the medication list at the
correct times and dosages and can monitor closely for adverse events and
drug levels. However, given the longer feedback loops in outpatient care,
providers lose much of this control and become more reliant on patients to
accurately report all medications and dosages they are taking. The number
of patients experiencing medication errors in the ambulatory setting is
staggering; a report from the Institute of Medicine in 2006 estimated
530,000 Medicare beneficiaries in ambulatory clinics experienced a
medication-related error in the year.8,9
Medication Reconciliation
Medication reconciliation should occur at every transition of care and
patient appointment. However, patients frequently do not know medication
names or doses, and time is not available to go through the entire
medication list. It has been estimated that a complete medication
reconciliation process takes between 15 and 30 minutes.10 Given the time
pressures on clinicians in the ambulatory setting, it is not surprising that
medication reconciliation may not routinely be completed. There is
significant potential for harm though as on discharge from the hospital, 23%
of patients were not taking their discharge medications and 29% had a
discrepancy between their discharge medication list and what they were
actually taking.11
Patient Adherence
Health care providers may fail to recognize the contribution of
nonadherence to a patient's health and medical condition. In one study
examining 195,000 newly prescribed e-prescriptions, only 72% were
filled.12 Medications for chronic conditions, such as diabetes, hypertension,
and hyperlipidemia, were more likely to have noncompliance. Health care
providers may overestimate patient's understanding of medications. In one
study of 359 adults waiting for an ambulatory appointment, understanding
of prescription label instructions ranged from 53% to 89%.13 Tools to help
patients adhere and understand their medications include providing a
medication list at every visit, encouraging patients to bring medications to
all appointments, providing patients with a pill box, using patient-friendly
language on the prescription instructions, and educating patients and
caregivers about important side effects and interactions.
Medication Monitoring
Many medications require careful monitoring in the outpatient setting.
Outpatient clinicians must create reliable processes to accurately monitor
these medications. The most common errors are failure to act on available
information, such as signs, symptoms, or laboratory values of drug toxicity
(e.g., failure to respond promptly to systems suggestive of digoxin toxicity)
and inadequate laboratory monitoring of drug therapies (e.g., checking
International normalized ratio [INRs] for patient on warfarin).9
Medication Prescribing
Prescribing errors are some of the most common in ambulatory medicine.
In one study evaluating 1879 prescriptions, 7.6% had a medication error
that was life threatening, serious, or significant.14 E-prescribing has shown
promise to decrease this amount of errors by requiring complete, legible
prescriptions, checking interactions, and checking allergies. A small study
of 15 providers showed a decrease in error rates from 42/100 prescriptions
to 6/100 prescriptions after implementation of an e-prescribing system with
clinical decision support including dosing recommendations and checks for
drug–drug interactions, patient allergies, and duplicate therapy.15
DIAGNOSTIC ERRORS
Diagnostic errors are defined as a delayed, missed, or incorrect diagnosis.
Given the brief, episodic nature of ambulatory care, diagnostic errors are a
threat to clinicians and patients. In one series of 307 closed malpractice
claims, cancer was the most commonly missed diagnosis (24% breast
cancer, 7% colorectal cancer, 8% skin cancer), followed by infections (5%),
fractures (4%), and myocardial infarctions (4%).16 These cases led to
significant or major physical adverse outcomes in 59% of cases and death
in 30% of cases. The breakdown points in the diagnostic process are listed
in Table 26-2.
TABLE 
26-2 
Breakdown 
Points 
in 
the 
Diagnostic 
Process
The outpatient setting is prone to diagnostic errors for a wide variety of
reasons. The clinician may receive inaccurate or insufficient information
from the patient or colleagues and may have inadequate or overwhelming
information from the patient's medical record. The busy and rushed nature
of ambulatory care lends itself to premature closure and other cognitive bias
by the provider. The physicians are often reliant on the patient to follow up
with requested laboratory or diagnostic testing to make a diagnosis and to
adhere to the treatment plan.
Methods to improve the diagnostic process focus on the provider–
patient encounter and the electronic medical record.17 Web portals that
allow patient and physician electronic transmission of laboratory and
diagnostic test results, recommendations, and communication are one
promising future strategy. Additionally, equipping EMRs with triggers,
mnemonics, or checklists is one possibility to help providers fully evaluate
a diagnosis. Employing point of care testing whenever possible allows for
immediate communication of results and establishment of a plan of care.
COMMUNICATION ERRORS
Numerous studies have shown that lapses in communication contribute to
poor quality care and patient safety. As discussed previously, the providers
rely on the patients to bring forward concerns, symptoms, and accurate
medical histories to help them diagnose problems and identify potential
adverse medication errors. However, during the clinical encounter,
physicians often lack the information needed. In a survey of 253 clinicians
in 32 Colorado practices, important information was missing at the time of
the visit in 13.6% of cases.18 The lack of information was thought to likely
lead to delayed care or duplicated care in 59.5% of the cases. The likelihood
of missing information increased as the number of active medical problems
increased (Fig. 26-1).
Figure 26-1 Ambulatory lapses in communication.
Similarly, the patients expect that their providers will provide them with
prompt information from study or laboratory results and clear follow-up
and treatment plans. Numerous gaps currently exist in the follow-up of
laboratory or radiology results. Reasons for errors in laboratory result
notification can be as simple as misfiling a paper or not having a chart
available. If patients do not hear from their physician, they may incorrectly
assume that the results were within normal limits and “no news is good
news.” Physicians report spending well over an hour per day managing test
results (74 minutes/day), but 83% reported that they wished they had
reviewed at least one test in the last 2 months earlier.19 Among surveyed
ambulatory medical practices, 52% reported having a system to record tests
ordered while only 32% of practices had systems to detect if patients
missed tests.
In the outpatient setting, the referral process is prone to breakdowns and
errors. Both specialists and primary care providers express frustration about
the referral process and communication between providers. The referral
process can be difficult due to physician time restraints, lack of clarity
regarding reason for referral, patient self-referrals, insurance limitations,
different medical record systems, and unclear follow-up plans (Table 26-
3).20 In a survey of 48 primary care providers, 63% reported being
dissatisfied with the referral process. Additionally neither the PCP nor the
specialist felt like they were receiving the information needed from the
other provider. In the outpatient setting, much of the referral process occurs
via notes and letters, rather than conversations between practitioners. This
lack of clear communication hinders the utility of many referrals.
TABLE 26-3 Breakdowns and Errors in the Outpatient Referral Process
LABORATORY ERRORS
Primary care providers order lab tests on an estimated 29–38% of
encounters.21 These laboratory tests can contribute to between 15% and
54% of errors in primary care. Primary care providers review a tremendous
amount of test results per week—one report found that a full-time primary
care provider will review 930 chemistry/hematology reports and 60
pathology and radiology reports in a week.22 Given that there is usually a
delay between seeing the patient, ordering the test, and obtaining the test
result, it is easy to forget about test results. Ambulatory offices lag behind
hospitals in developing and implementing systems to prevent errors from
occurring. There are multiple steps that occur between ordering a test to
acting upon the test results; errors may occur at each of these steps (Fig. 26-
2). Types of errors include missed/delayed provider of test results, patient
follow-up of test results, patient notification about test result, and laboratory
errors such as incorrectly labeling or processing a specimen. Unfortunately,
few practices have systems in place to accurately track labs ordered,
reporting of results, and patient notification.23 A survey of primary care
providers similarly showed that 37% of providers had seen a patient in the
last 2 weeks with a missed test result.24 The most commonly missed
diagnostic studies included imaging (29%), common clinical pathology
(22%), anatomic pathology (9%) and other studies (40%). The most
common diagnosis that had a delay in care was cancer (34%). In addition to
the process steps, errors can occur if the provider orders the wrong test or
when the appropriate test is not ordered.25 Standardization of the test result
process is one important tool to decrease errors. Practices should have a
standard way to order tests, track results, respond and document test results,
and notify patients.21 Engaging patients to be active participants in their
care is one potential strategy for mitigating risk. Although many patients
may assume that “no news is good news,” encouraging patients to actively
seek out their test results may add another layer of defense against missed
test results. Electronic tracking systems and patient portals are promising
methods for monitoring test results, but more research is still needed to
investigate best practices for ordering and following up on abnormal labs.
Figure 26-2 Steps in ordering and receiving a laboratory result.
ADMINISTRATIVE ERRORS
Currently, there is very little research on administrative errors in the
outpatient setting. However, many providers will experience events like a
misplaced laboratory result or the front desk forgetting to call a patient to
schedule an appointment; all of these common scenarios can lead to adverse
events. Creating a culture of safety and designing systems with built-in
safeguards are two important principles to mitigate these types of errors.
Specific interventions suggested by a study of family physicians included
stopping using carbon copy prescription forms, doing urgent lab tests in the
office, and using flagging systems.26 Best practices from the Joint
Commission include standardization of:
Types of files, shapes, colors, and labels.
Formatting of files.
Process used for filing such that it becomes habitual.
Method of sign-off.
Methodology of nonsoftware filing systems on every person's
computer.
Forced functions built into software systems such that filing something
incorrectly will be immediately noticed and intercepted.5
Patients often make their first impressions of a practice based on the
medical office staff that often function as a gateway to the medical
providers. Being on time and accessible are important for patient
satisfaction and can signal how an office is functioning. Potential metrics to
measure include number of patient “touches,” being time, on-time starts,
appointment access, and telephone access.27
Improving communication among office staff is another potential
means to reduce the risk of error. For example, creating an interdisciplinary
team (e.g., physician, nurse, office manager, scheduler) to improve the
handling of phone messages could be done using PDSA cycles,27 leading to
a collaborative and sustainable solution. Ambulatory practices can benefit
from the use of daily briefings and huddles to improve communication
among team members.27
SAFETY 
AND 
QUALITY 
IN
PRIMARY CARE
Primary care providers have a crucial role in following and managing
patients. Given the increasing complexity of health care, many people now
are receiving care by a variety of clinicians in many different settings and
facilities. The PCP is supposed to be the link between all these different
providers. However, PCPs are under increased pressure to see more
patients, maximize billing, manage transitions of care, and track quality.
The agenda in an outpatient visit is jam-packed: addressing patient concerns
and medical problems, creating and updating a problem list, reconciling
medications, reviewing allergies, documenting a review of systems,
completing a physical exam, ordering tests, prescribing new medications,
making referrals, coordinating testing logistics, allowing time for questions,
and doing this all in a patient-centered manner! The average primary care
encounter lasts around 17–20 minutes and covers six topics.28,29
Unfortunately, there is little time to do all that needs to be done.
A gap exists between recommended care and actual care received by
patients. For example, in 2011, between only 58.4% and 65.4% of patients
diagnosed with hypertension had adequate control. The breast cancer
screening rate varies between 50.4% and 70.5%.30 Another analysis showed
that only 54.9% of the population received recommended preventative
care.31 Common outpatient quality improvement projects often involve
preventive and chronic care. The Ambulatory Care Quality Alliance (AQA)
was started in 2004 as collaboration between the American Academy of
Family Physicians (AAFP), the American College of Physicians (ACP),
America's Health Insurance Plans (AHIP), and the Agency for Healthcare
Research and Quality (AHRQ) to improve collection and reporting of
ambulatory quality measures.
A “starter set” of 26 measures was developed for ambulatory care
covering cancer screening, vaccination, tobacco use and cessation, coronary
artery disease, heart failure, diabetes, depression, asthma, prenatal care, and
antibiotic use.32 This starter set is one possible framework for practices that
wish to begin collecting, analyzing, and improving on ambulatory quality
metrics.
The creation of Primary Care Medical Homes (PCMH) is another
possible mechanism to improve the quality and safety provided to patients.
The AHRQ defines a PCMH as a “mechanism for organizing primary care
to provide high-quality care across the full range of an individual's health
care needs. It focuses on teams of health care professionals proving
coordinated and accessible care to an identifiable group of patients.”33
PCMH aim to create care that is patient centered, comprehensive,
coordinated, accessible, and committed to quality and safety. Each patient
has an ongoing relationship with a personal physician. The practice works
as a team to address the patient's needs, ongoing care, and access to
services.34 A systematic review showed that PCMH has a small positive
effect on patient experience and small to moderate positive effect on
preventative care.33 This concept is also expanding to Patient Centered
Medical Home Neighbors for specialty and subspecialty practices to
improve communication and comanagement between PCPs and consultants.
CREATING 
AN 
OUTPATIENT
SAFETY 
AND 
QUALITY
PROGRAM
To date, much of the safety and quality focus has been on the inpatient
setting. However, with increasing emphasis on value-based purchasing and
public reporting, outpatient medical practices will face increasing pressure
to create and maintain quality and safety programs. The EHR incentive
program includes clinical quality measures that practices will have to report
on. A recommended core set of measures for adults and pediatrics that
focuses on high-priority health conditions and best practices has been
complied, which includes controlling high blood pressure, tobacco use
screening and cessation, and childhood immunization status.35 Many
physicians are being required to perform a self-assessment and quality
improvement project for their practice as part of their maintenance of
certification through their medical board.
Many practices may feel overwhelmed by quality improvement projects
and data reporting. Historically, safety and quality improvement have been
a relatively small component in medical education, making it difficult for
existing practices to create a safety and quality program that engages the
multitude of roles involved in safe medical care. At a minimum,
components of an outpatient safety and quality improvement program
should include the following:
Providing training for staff
Identifying key areas for improvement
Identifying and removing barriers of improvement
Creating a tracking system for quality and safety issues
Developing specific safety and quality goals that are reviewed
regularly
Developing metrics that measure the safety and quality of care
Assigning of responsibility and accountability to monitor metrics
Supporting a Just culture and reporting of errors
Engaging patients36
Multiple preexisting frameworks exist for quality improvement programs,
and some of these programs will assist with the analysis of data. Many
different specialty societies have quality programs with suggested metrics.
National organizations have preestablished metrics that can be followed
based upon disease, specialty, and patient population. These resources can
be beneficial for practices learning about quality improvement.
SUMMARY
Improving patient safety and quality for the ambulatory setting is a much
needed next step for the quality movement. As more care is transitioned to
outpatients, the potential amount of harm will be increasing. Creating a
taxonomy to define errors is a first step, followed by creating a safe culture
and error reporting systems, to finally creating system-based solutions to
decrease errors. Major areas of interest include communication, medication
safety, diagnostic error, laboratory error, and administrative error. While
principles learned from the inpatient setting may be useful to improve care,
these tools will need to be adapted to the outpatient setting. Despite many
of the difficulties, some safety and quality initiatives in the outpatient
setting may be more feasible since patients are not as acutely ill, allowing
them to be more engaged. Additionally, most outpatient clinics will have a
smaller staff, which may make it easier to implement and communicate
changes. Therefore, smaller, easier tools or system changes can have large
impacts without as much time and money invested when compared to the
inpatient setting.4 Practices need to look at their relationship with
consultants, laboratories, hospitals, and home health organizations to ensure
that they have methods to track patients and communicate results.
KEY POINTS
Outpatient safety and quality differs from inpatient care due to the
large volume of patients, longitudinal care, and the diffuse care
environment.
The wide variety of outpatient settings and providers can make
safety and quality work challenging.
Outpatient practices need to identify ways to standardize systems,
identify errors, and maintain a just culture.
Causes of errors include medication errors, diagnostic errors,
laboratory errors, clinical knowledge errors, communication
errors, and administrative errors.

27 Patient Safety Issues Specific to
Psychiatry
Anne L. Glowinski
CLINICAL VIGNETTE
Mr. L is a 22-year-old Caucasian male group home resident. His live-in
caretakers assist him daily for functional impairment secondary to his
intellectual disability. He presents to the emergency department (ED) with 2
days of acute mood and behavior changes. He is eating and sleeping poorly
and is uncharacteristically “on and off” grumpy. Mr. L suffers from long-
standing generalized epilepsy. No seizures have been observed since he
started topiramate 10 days ago. While in the ED, Mr. L alternates between
calm and agitated states. A brief physical exam is uninformative. His heart
rate fluctuates between 75 and 135. Psychiatry is consulted for “mental
status changes.” The psychiatry consultant lists “delirium” as the likely
diagnosis and recommends identifying and correcting the underlying cause
of delirium to avoid a worsening clinical course. He particularly
recommends talking to Mr. L's neurologist today about epilepsy
management because topiramate is a known deliriogenic agent. The patient,
calm for 2 hours, is discharged with a diagnosis of “rule out psychiatric
disorder” and a recommendation to arrange follow-up with his neurologist.
Mr. L is back in the ED a few hours later. He became agitated again and
broke a chair on the head of another group home resident.
What are the basic steps for diagnosing and treating delirium?
What might have prevented serious injury to another person?
INTRODUCTION
The interface of Psychiatry and General Hospital Medicine presents
significant opportunities to positively impact and improve the quality and
safety of patient care. This is because psychiatric and behavioral disorders,
with or without other comorbidities, are ubiquitous across health care
settings.1–3
Large-scale psychiatric epidemiologic studies, such as the National
Comorbidity Survey Replication, have demonstrated that many individuals
with mental health problems, including severe and chronic disorders, are
still unlikely to ever be seen or followed for those problems.4 Hence, the
patient with psychiatric symptoms in acute medical settings will typically
not have been assessed previously or longitudinally by a mental health
expert. Furthermore, that patient will be under the care of physicians with a
relative paucity of knowledge or expertise in the identification and
management of psychiatric syndromes. Such a patient will be at risk of
harm from both suboptimal management of his or her psychiatric disorders
due to provider inexperience and poorer management of medical problems
occurring in the context of comorbid psychiatric or behavioral symptoms.
How perilous is the latter for patients? It is very serious, as illustrated by
several studies documenting that, when compared with other patients, those
with psychiatric disorders have notably worse outcomes from their medical
problems.5
Nevertheless, psychiatric disorders remain relatively underemphasized
in medical education, including in residency training for clinical specialties
where the psychiatric contribution to patient morbidity and mortality is
pervasive. For instance, a general pediatric resident training in 2014 must
rotate through 2 months of neonatal critical care and 2 months of pediatric
critical care (as per ACGME guidelines) but is not required to rotate
through Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.6 This is but one example of a
training curriculum that clashes with reality as suicide is consistently the
second or third leading cause of pediatric death in youth 10–18 and the
CDC currently reports a 16% incidence of serious suicidal ideation by US
high school students in the past 12 months.7
Pragmatically addressing this expertise deficit in settings where patients
with psychiatric disorders routinely and normatively present is a
fundamental task for any group, project, organization, or institution leading
efforts to enhance patient safety and quality of medical care.
DELIRIUM
The hallmark of delirium (sometimes also called “acute confusional state”
by nonpsychiatrists) is a consciousness disturbance (e.g., decreased
attention focus, sustenance, or control), characteristically over brief periods
of time (e.g., hours or days). It is characterized by a fluctuating course (e.g.,
disturbance alternating with periods of normal or less abnormal level of
consciousness). Table 27-1 details the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders 5th edition (DSM-5) diagnostic criteria for delirium.8 Not
considered to be core criteria and particularly confusing for most clinicians
are commonly associated emotional symptoms such as tearfulness,
expressions of sorrow, sadness, depression, or any change from the patient's
mood or affect baseline. Notably, the disturbance in level of consciousness
can present as either agitation or quiet confusion, the latter being
particularly likely to be missed in medical floors and ICUs.
TABLE 27-1 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5th
Edition: 
Delirium 
Criteria
It is critical for physicians and nurses to fully appreciate that delirium is
generally, in this country and others, poorly recognized and yet very
common in general hospital settings. This is especially the case in ICU
patients and in patients over 65 where delirium rates are estimated to range
from 50% to 70%.9 Improved identification and more systematic
management of delirium could potentially improve hospital and
posthospital mortality and morbidity rates across gender, age, and race.
Delirium is also notoriously associated with higher health care costs, which
could perhaps be moderated as well.10
Delirium comprises a set of behavioral, emotional, and cognitive
symptoms that is ironically often considered “medical” by psychiatrists and
“psychiatric” by other physicians. This common misinterpretation increases
the risk of inadequate management of delirious patients by everyone!
Delirium is (i) a serious syndrome, with high morbidity and mortality; (ii)
not caused directly by primary psychiatric disturbances; and (iii)
nonspecific, similar to a fever. Delirium requires urgent medical,
nonpsychiatric workup and management because of its significant
association with adverse outcomes. Psychiatrists are often consulted to
evaluate the agitation or hallucinations of delirious patients either because
they are thought to suffer from primary psychiatric disturbances or because
they need symptomatic management.
The pathophysiology of delirium is complex and multifactorial; an
exploration of the contemporary theories of causation exceeds the scope of
this chapter. It is commonly summarized and remembered with the ominous
mnemonic “I WATCH DEATH” (see Table 27-2), a stern reminder of the
serious nature of delirium and also a quick guide to a comprehensive
workup to identify, correct, or mitigate underlying problem(s).

The difficulty in recognizing delirium further increases risk to patients.
Adverse outcomes include terror or discomfort, preventable falls, injuries to
self or others, and worsening medical conditions. A useful tool to
methodically assess for delirium is the Confusion Assessment Method
(CAM) (see Table 27-3).10 The CAM is superior to using clinical acumen,
which will often convince physicians that they are in the presence of a
mentally disturbed patient rather than a medically impaired one. The CAM
has been validated more than other existing instruments.11,12 Steps involved
in the management of delirium are outlined in Figure 27-1. Importantly,
delirium can be hypo- or hyperactive and it can be multifactorial. Also,
recovery can be progressive and slow even after correction of triggering
agent(s). Morbidity can occur either because of uncorrected underlying
problems or because of the higher prevalence of erratic behaviors in
delirious patients.

AGGRESSION
Aggression by patients or visitors in health care settings is a common and
potentially dangerous phenomenon. It is often directed toward nurses and
also experienced by physicians and other professionals. Aggression in
general hospitals and elsewhere does not just originate from patients or
visitors with psychiatric disorders. However, several psychiatric,
behavioral, and personality disorders predispose to aggression in stressful
acute care settings. The health care costs of aggression, or its threat, are
high because of absenteeism and staff work stress.
We should first note that (i) research into the scope of the problem of
health care setting aggression is more advanced than the research on its
prevention and management and (ii) the research so far often lumps
qualitatively distinct aggressive acts ranging from verbal aggression to
assault. What is relatively well known from a recent systematic review is (i)
of known risk factors for aggression, none is as predictive as a previous
history of aggression; (ii) staff training appears critical for prevention and
management of aggression, in part because it mediates improved team
functioning; (iii) chemical restraints are widely used with efficacy of certain
agents or combination of agents better established for patients with
aggression related to psychosis; and (iv) mechanical restraints if applied
appropriately, carefully, and parsimoniously can be useful and relatively
safe in the management of aggression.13,14 Regarding the prevention and
management of aggression, because of the paucity of randomized clinical
trials, the evidence is currently only preliminary. Much of the research on
aggression comes from psychiatric inpatient settings, which does not
translate well to other settings given systematic differences between their
patient and staff populations. Findings from research in nonpsychiatric
settings have well documented the typical absence of preparedness of many
health care workers in preventing or managing aggression. Notably, there
are no prevention algorithms applicable to every setting because health care
settings differ importantly across key variables (e.g., types of patients or
visitors, spatial variables, served communities, systems, or on-site
resources) so that the establishment of multidisciplinary teams is highly
recommended when a hospital or a unit prioritizes quality improvement
efforts in this domain. One recommendation, however, can be made
emphatically: firearms or weapons in a hospital, including those carried by
security or law enforcement officers, significantly increase the risk of very
serious aggression injury to patients and others.15
The use of chemical restraints highly depends on the setting, which will
often dictate whether an agent like midazolam can or cannot be used safely.
Similarly, each clinical situation will dictate whether an oral agent is
feasible or if an agent with a less rapid onset of action like an atypical
antipsychotic is preferable to a relatively faster-acting agent like haloperidol
or lorazepam. Familiarity with dosage recommendations, potential side
effects, and interactions of better-studied agents used to mitigate aggression
is essential (e.g., droperidol, haloperidol, midazolam, lorazepam).
Mechanical restraints are also widely used especially in emergency
departments (EDs) and intensive care units (ICUs), and when used
appropriately and ethically, they can have an important role. A 1-year long
prospective study of mechanical restraint use, with or without adjunctive
use of chemical restraints, in a busy inner-city American ED, suggested a
7% rate of mostly minor complications. Most of the complications stemmed
from patients getting out of restraints, but there were few injuries to self or
others.16 Notably, this low rate of complications occurred in the context of
mindful use (e.g., using checklists, monitoring patients and tracking time
spent in restraints).
Expert consensus points to the prevention of aggression in health care
settings as an area ripe for further research in quality improvement. For
instance, staff harmony may be more efficacious at preventing aggression in
health care settings than a show of force by physically intimidating male
staff.13
SUICIDE
Suicide is defined as a sentinel event by the Joint Commission with the
stated goal of zero suicides in health care settings. Suicide in and out of
hospitals remains a vexing problem: there are now many well-known
suicide risk factors but that knowledge has not successfully led to
significant prevention at the population level. The latest National Strategy
for Suicide Prevention is extremely ambitious.17 This plan recognizes that a
strategy piecing together many prevention and intervention networks,
cumulatively highly sensitive to the major suicide risk factors, is necessary
to combat this enormous public health problem. This plan also states
explicitly that the battle for suicide prevention can only be won by
transcending the bounds of psychiatric management: suicide needs
interdisciplinary solutions.
What about suicide in health care settings? Despite being defined as a
sentinel event, the global burden of suicide in medical settings remains
unknown.18 There is some overlap between suicide risk factors for
psychiatric inpatients and the general hospital inpatients such as male
gender, a history of suicide attempt including suicide attempt leading to
admission for medical clearance, lack of social or familial support, and
depression. Some factors are unique to general medical inpatients, such as
being middle aged, poor adjustment to catastrophic or chronic medical
illness, and agitated delirium leading to erratic mood and behavior.19
Prevention of inpatient suicide requires a multidisciplinary approach,
including an environmental evaluation, mental health screening for
inpatients, treatment of psychiatric disease, staff training, and establishment
of policies regarding suicide risk monitoring.19 Reports of success
following systematic depression care have been impressive; the Henry Ford
Health System noted a 75% decrease in patient suicide after implementation
of the “perfect depression care program.”20 Targeted training in Suicide
Risk Assessment (SRA) has been demonstrated as feasible and can increase
confidence of nonpsychiatrist physicians, but the systematic deployment of
SRA (beyond depression care) across many hospital settings could be
premature.21,22 More research is needed to understand how to implement
Suicide Risk Assessment tools across different health care settings and with
different patient populations.
MEDICATION-RELATED
PSYCHIATRIC EMERGENCIES
ED and general hospital physicians are relatively familiar with some
medication-related psychiatric emergencies such as suicide attempt or
inadvertent drug overdose, which will not be discussed extensively here.
Some general hospitals choose to employ dedicated teams to manage
overdoses. Such teams can include toxicology, critical care, and mental
health or substance use experts. Notably, prescription opiate overdoses have
become epidemic. Nearly two million people in the US are dependent or
abusing opioids, and deaths from prescription pain killers have quadrupled
since 1999.23 Examination, monitoring, and improvement of physician
prescribing practices, which contribute to those partially iatrogenic deaths,
could be greatly facilitated by state prescription registries or drug
monitoring programs, now available in almost all states.
Two syndromes merit further discussion: neuroleptic malignant
syndrome (NMS), which occurs in patients who are taking dopamine
antagonists such as typical or atypical antipsychotics or other dopamine
blockers, and serotonergic syndrome (SS), which occurs in patients on
serotonergic drugs such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)
or serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). These syndromes
are important because they are highly lethal if unrecognized or poorly
managed and because they have a relatively good prognosis if recognized
and managed appropriately. NMS has a variably acute onset of about 3
days, whereas SS tends to be even more acute with an onset of about 12
hours. As noted in a review by Bienvenu et al.,12 NMS and SS share
identical features of serious autonomic instability with hypertension,
tachycardia, tachypnea, and hyperthermia, severe hypersalivation and
diaphoresis. They have overlapping features of variably altered mental
states and abnormal muscle findings; NMS patients typically exhibit “lead-
pipe” rigidity contrasting with SS patients, who typically exhibit
hypertonia, particularly in lower extremities. The two syndromes are
distinguished by hyporeflexia, normal pupils, and normal or decreased
bowel sounds in NMS and hyperreflexia or clonus, dilated pupils, and
hyperactive bowel sounds in SS. It is very critical to not confuse the two
syndromes while toxicology results are pending but management needs to
be initiated. Bromocriptine or dantrolene, which can help manage NMS,
can exacerbate symptoms or be lethal in SS patients. The Hunter Serotonin
Toxicity Criteria should be used to diagnose SS in patients on a serotonergic
agent who have spontaneous clonus, inducible clonus, agitation,
diaphoresis, tremor, hyperreflexia, high temperature (>38°C), and
hypertonicity/rigidity; the criteria have excellent sensitivity and specificity
compared to diagnosis by an expert toxicologist.24 Figure 27-1 illustrates
the steps that should be considered for management of NMS and SS.
CONCLUSION
An important subtext, not developed in this chapter, is that advocacy for
improving access to psychiatrist care is highly encouraged. Optimal
interdisciplinary collaborations to improve psychiatric care of patients in
every setting would greatly benefit from the psychiatric field's development
of mental health quality indicators. Such indicators are currently not
commonly used to evaluate psychiatric or mental health services.
Healthcare workers should be prepared to encounter patients with
psychiatric symptoms and to be able to initially manage these patients. For
some of issues such as delirium, aggression, and the management
psychiatric medication adverse effects, empirical evidence suggests that
patient care and safety would improve if awareness, knowledge, expertise,
and specific algorithms were disseminated outside the bounds of psychiatric
circles.
KEY POINTS
Delirium is a serious medical problem, which is often confused
with primary psychotic or mood disorders. It is associated with
high morbidity and mortality and high health care costs.
Especially for nonpsychiatrists, the use of the Confusion
Assessment Method (CAM) to diagnose delirium, is highly
recommended.
Staff training is critical to prevent and manage aggression in
health care settings.
The 2012 National Strategy for Suicide Prevention calls for
dissemination of suicide prevention efforts and expertise outside
of mental health bounds.

CLINICAL VIGNETTE
A hypotensive patient arrived in the emergency department bleeding from
internal injuries after a car accident. She received multiple units of type O
red blood cells until her blood type was determined on a pretransfusion
sample. Subsequently, the patient received B+ red cells. Bleeding was
surgically controlled, and the patient's condition stabilized except for acute
kidney injury, hematuria, and anemia. Seventy-two hours later, the blood
bank required a new blood specimen for repeat typing, and now, the
patient's blood tested positive for both type A+ and B+ red cells, indicating
her true blood type was A+ and she had been erroneously transfused with B+
red cells. Further investigation showed that the patient treated in the trauma
room prior to this patient was blood type B+. The conclusion of a root cause
analysis was that an unlabeled tube of blood from the previous patient was
labeled as the next patient's blood leading to release of B+ incompatible red
cells, an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction, and possibly contributing to
the patient's kidney failure. Emergency department staff was informed of
the consequences of the mislabeled specimen error, and they participated in
revising processes and procedures for labeling blood specimens on trauma
patients.
How can the collection, labeling, and handling errors of laboratory and
pathology samples be minimized?
What are some of the other important safety and quality issues that are
unique to clinical laboratory, transfusion medicine, and anatomic
pathology services?
INTRODUCTION
Most medical diagnostic and management decisions depend upon
information provided by clinical laboratories or pathology services. In order
to avoid sentinel patient safety errors like the one described in the clinical
vignette, quality systems must be in place, monitored, and supported to
minimize the risk of preanalytical, analytical, and postanalytical errors. This
chapter first reviews the principles of quality assurance as they apply to
clinical laboratory services and then provides specific guidance for
transfusion medicine and anatomic pathology services.
A QUALITY SYSTEM APPROACH
TO 
CLINICAL 
LABORATORY
SERVICES
The principles of quality management and improvement introduced in
Chapters 2–6 also apply to clinical laboratory services.
Laboratory leaders participate in a wide range of primarily operational
quality and safety activities to ensure tests are done correctly1 (Table 28-1).
However, laboratory medicine quality indicators should be expanded to
include all activities, which contribute to ordering the most clinically useful
tests and to interpreting the results appropriately2 (Table 28-2). There are
two types of medical errors, and the laboratory testing process is vulnerable
to both of them: knowledge-based and rule-based mistakes and execution
errors when a repetitive task is done incorrectly.

PRELABORATORY PROCESSES
Test Ordering Decisions: Primarily Cognitive
Errors
How clinicians decide which tests to order for a patient's condition is
extremely complex, but there is wide acceptance that the number of ordered
tests does not correlate with the quality of patient care and may be
associated with adverse outcomes including patient dissatisfaction from
frequent phlebotomies, iatrogenic anemia, and potentially harmful tests and
procedures to “follow-up” on unexpected, often false-positive, results.
Motivations for excessive testing include time pressure to evaluate multiple
diagnoses simultaneously rather than sequentially, unselective testing due to
knowledge deficits, and insecurity, in the presence of uncertainty, about
relying on clinical judgment and experience. These are long-term
challenges for medical educators and clinical mentors, but informatics tools
can provide immediate assistance:
Benefits of computer provider order entry (CPOE)
Standardized test menu prevents vague, illegible written orders.
Customized order sets for common clinical conditions improve
efficiency.
Improved utilization of diagnostic tests3:
Online aids: laboratory test handbook, algorithms for
sequential testing of common diagnostic pathways, and
decision support tools (dosing algorithms, evidence-based
guidelines, general medical information).
Display cost of selected tests.4
Noninterruptive alerts and advice: for example, duplicate test
warning while providing most recent result.5
Interruptive alerts: require action to complete order: provide
indication and contact laboratory to request exemption from
institutional rules.
Potential problems with CPOE
Pop-up fatigue from alerts: ignored or bypassed.
Ordering convenience causes excess testing: checking every box
on an order set and automatic routine daily tests.
Order sets require maintenance to keep up with changes in
practice standards.6
Confusing test names without key word search functionality leads
to incorrect test selection.7
Specimen collection and processing errors primarily slipups:
Specimen collection and labeling mistakes are the major sources
of laboratory errors.8
Phlebotomy-related needlestick injuries are a major risk for
transmission of infectious diseases for health care workers.9
Included in the Federal Needlestick Safety Prevention Act
(NSPA) of 2000 was a requirement for employers to provide
safety-engineered devices to those performing activities such
as phlebotomy, inserting venous and arterial lines, obtaining
body fluid and tissue samples, and surgical procedures.
NSPA is enforced by the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration (OSHA).
In post-NSPA enactment in 2001, annual rates of
percutaneous injuries (PI) dropped nearly in half to 1–
2.5/100 full-time employees.10,11
In 2002, a prospective survey of house staff reported an
overall PI rate of 2.9/100 first year residents/month. Highest
PI rates were for OB-GYN (9.7), surgery (7.2), and
pathology (5.3) first year residents. Forty percent of PIs were
from needlesticks.12
Among the first year residents, PIs occurred approximately
twice as often at night or after overnight call (extended
hours) and were more likely to be attributed to fatigue
compared to PIs occurring during nonextended hours.12
Collection errors
Hemolysis due to collecting blood in a syringe from an IV;
accessing small distal veins, using small-bore needle (gauge
< 21).13
Blood contamination from IV fluid, heparin, or skin flora
causing chemistry, coagulation, and microbiology artifacts.
Incorrect collection tube, quantity not sufficient (QNS), and
inadequate mixing with anticoagulant causing a clotted
sample.
Specimen mislabeling is the most serious type of specimen
collection errors. A survey of US clinical laboratories identified
379 specimen identification errors per million billable tests,
which is an underestimate due to insensitive detection methods.14
Many labeling errors are identified before releasing test
results: during laboratory processing or when results are
different from previous results for the same patient (δ
checks).
Other labeling errors are identified after releasing results due
to clinician inquiries.
Clinical consequences of undetected specimen labeling
errors are difficult to quantify, except for fatalities due to
blood typing labeling errors, but given the billions of
orderable tests performed annually, there must be adverse
consequences due to treatment decisions based on incorrect
information.
Bedside technology can reduce specimen labeling errors. Bar
code technology for electronic positive patient identification
(ePPID) reduces mislabeled specimen rates.15 However, staff
can create work-arounds for any technological improvement
unless there is a supportive culture for process improvement,
patient safety, and regular competency assessment.
Specimen transportation: Time, temperature, and trauma can
cause ex vivo changes in cellular and chemical parameters.8
Some pneumatic tube system designs produce physical
forces causing platelet activation16 and hemolysis causing
clinically significant changes in potassium, phosphate,
lactate dehydrogenase, and aspartate aminotransferase.17
Laboratories should compare results from split samples
transported by walkers and via pneumatic tube system to rule
out these preanalytical sources of errors before accepting
“tubed” specimens.
In-Laboratory 
Processes 
and 
Errors:
Primarily 
Slipups, 
Rarely 
Analytical
Mistakes
Laboratory automation reduces “slipup” processing errors and improves
turnaround times in proportion to the number of steps that are performed by
machines. However, even the most automated clinical laboratory relies on
manual processes for some test methods, handling urgent testing (code
specimens), sending out esoteric tests to reference laboratories, and calling
and documenting critical value alerts to clinicians.
Analytical step: High-volume tests are performed using federal Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) licensed automated instruments and
reagents with excellent precision and accuracy specifications.18
Quality metrics include the following:
Quality control (QC): frequently testing stable, normal, and
abnormal materials whose results must be within established
narrow ranges.
Periodic validation of instrument calibration and linearity for
quantitative methods.
External proficiency testing: comparing analyte results to results
from other laboratories testing identical specimens and using the
same instruments and reagents (peer group).
Accuracy surveys: comparing analyte results to an international
standard method (available for a growing number of tests).
Sporadic QC outliers or unacceptable deviations from proficiency
or accuracy external survey results require process review and
reagent/instrument troubleshooting.
Reporting test results: Automated instruments directly transmit most
results to the laboratory information system (LIS) software, which
relays them to electronic medical record (EMR) systems, reducing
turnaround times and the risk of postanalytical manual transcription
errors. Establishing and periodically validating the fidelity of
instrument to LIS and LIS to EMR electronic interfaces require
considerable informatics support.
Test result enhancements and interpretations: Most test results are
accompanied by reference ranges derived from a small sample of
healthy individuals, and the ordering clinician must determine the
meaning of an “outlier” result.
For some tests, standard interpretive comments, therapeutic
ranges, or automated calculations assist clinicians with test
interpretation, therapeutic drug monitoring, assessing renal
function, or following a diagnostic algorithm.
Tests requiring customized interpretations by a pathologist or
clinical scientist are limited: examples include blood smear
morphology, urine sediment microscopy, hemoglobin and protein
electrophoresis, hypercoagulation panels, selected molecular
diagnostic tests, and blood bank serology workups; they require
selective peer review to ensure professional competency and to
minimize incorrect, ambiguous, or delayed test interpretations,
which can cause adverse clinical events.
Clinical laboratories issue corrected reports for preanalytical,
analytical, or interpretation errors. Electronic and printed reports
must be revised, clearly showing the original and corrected result.
Monitoring the frequency and causes of corrected reports and
effectiveness of process improvement actions are crucial quality
management goals.
Post–Laboratory Test Result Errors
Clinicians can commit both slipup and cognitive errors after laboratory
results are released.
Ignoring test results: Other than for critical results, laboratories do not
ensure clinicians review test results, which are available to them via
electronic or printed reports. Yet, ignoring results, failing to act upon
them, or not informing patients of their test results are important
postanalytical errors. One safeguard is to provide patients with online
access to some of their test results as many health systems are now
doing.
Cognitive errors based on incorrect interpretation of test results are
difficult to quantify but are probably common given the continuously
expanding complexities of diagnosis and treatment of human illnesses.
Rapid access to electronic medical decision support resources can
mitigate these errors and can be embedded within an EMR. For
example, warfarindosing.org is a Web-based algorithm for predicting a
patient's therapeutic warfarin dose based on clinical, demographic,
and, if available, pharmacogenetic information.
BLOOD TRANSFUSION SAFETY
AND QUALITY MANAGEMENT
Collection, processing, and administration of blood products from
volunteers are closely scrutinized with oversight of all or selected activities
by the Joint Commission, American Association of Blood Banks (AABB),
FDA, and, if blood products are irradiated, the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission and Homeland Security.
Blood Donors
Approximately 16 million volunteer blood donations are collected annually.
They may occur at a free-standing facility or at a hospital transfusion
department. Procedures range from simple phlebotomy to collect whole
blood to apheresis to collect single components. Processing of whole blood
usually includes removal of white cells by filtration to reduce intracellular
pathogens like cytomegalovirus (CMV) and reduces febrile transfusion
reactions and separation of plasma from red cells by centrifugation.
Donor Safety and Satisfaction
Donating blood involves risks (hematoma, vasovagal reactions, seizure,
and, extremely rarely, death), requires informed consent, and requires that
the donor meets specific eligibility criteria.19 A positive donor experience
encourages repeat donations, which are important to maintain an adequate
and safe blood supply.
Protecting Recipients from Harm
Donors undergo direct questioning to identify medical and travel histories,
and behaviors, which could increase the risk of adverse events to a
recipient. Deferrals are based on FDA regulations and AABB standards.20
Donated blood is tested for at least seven pathogens using serologic and
molecular methods (Table 28-3). Units with positive test results are
destroyed, and donors are contacted, instructed not to donate again, and
provided initial counseling. Rare cases of transfusion-transmitted dengue
fever and babesiosis in the US are examples of emerging infectious disease
risks requiring quantitative risk assessment before making policy decisions
to add additional testing and expense to the blood collection process.22
TABLE 28-3 FDA Required Testing of Donated Blood for Seven
Pathogens to Prevent Infectious Disease Transmission to Recipients
From Roback J, Grossman B, Harris T, et al., eds. Technical Manual. 17th ed. Bethesda, MD: AABB;
2011.
The risks of transmission of HIV, HCV, and HBV are extremely low but
will never be zero due to narrow window periods (7–10 days for HIV and
HCV, and 38 days for HBV) when viral loads are below detection and
donors remain asymptomatic.21
Bacterial contamination of a blood product can occur if a donor has
bacteremia and is asymptomatic or if bacteria are introduced into the
collection bag. Sepsis and death due to contaminated blood products are
rare 
events.21 
Freezing 
plasma 
prevents 
bacterial 
multiplication.
Refrigeration of red cells restricts growth to certain gram-negative
pathogens—Yersinia 
enterocolitica 
and 
Serratia 
marcescens 
most
commonly. Platelet units are stored at room temperature and have the
highest relative risk of causing transfusion-related sepsis, due to both gram-
positive and gram-negative organisms. To reduce this risk, platelets expire 5
days after collection and a sample of the unit is cultured after 24 hours and
quarantined from 12 to 24 hours prior to its release.20
Blood collection centers perform ABO and Rh typing and antibody
screens of donor blood and discard units with clinically important
alloantibodies to other red cell antigens, which could cause hemolytic
reactions in a recipient.
Blood Recipient
Approximately 5 million patients receive blood transfusions each year.
Despite low risks of contracting HIV, hepatitis C or B, or other infections
(i.e., blood safety), transfusion of red blood cells, plasma, and platelets
involves other short-term and potentially fatal risks (Table 28-4). The most
common cause of fatalities from transfusion is transfusion-related acute
lung injury (TRALI). TRALI typically occurs when patients with
underlying inflammatory or infectious conditions are transfused with a
blood product from a multiparous female donor whose plasma contains
HLA antibodies recognizing recipient neutrophils and inducing cytokine-
mediated lung injury. Blood centers no longer provide plasma from women
and reduced exposure to platelets containing HLA antibodies, which has
decreased TRALI fatalities (Table 28-4).

HTR, hemolytic transfusion reaction; TACO, transfusion-associated cardiac
overload; TRALI, transfusion-related acute lung injury.
Errors can occur at many points from donor blood collection to transfusion
into the recipient (Table 28-5). Special attention is given to questionable
decisions to transfuse, suboptimal informed consent process, mislabeled
blood samples for blood typing, and transfusion of the wrong blood product
into a patient.

Blood Management
Avoidance of unnecessary blood transfusions optimizes patient safety,
making the decision to transfuse a critically important step. Comprehensive
blood management programs focus on correction and prevention of anemia
prior to major surgery, minimizing blood loss with preoperative
hemodilution and red cell salvage, restoration of coagulopathies during
surgery, and using evidence-based guidelines for hemoglobin nadir
thresholds for transfusion of hemodynamically stable anemic medical
patients when appropriate.23
Informed Consent
Prior to blood transfusions in nonemergent situations, it is mandatory to
obtain a patient's informed consent. AABB minimum standards are
description of risk, benefits, and treatment alternatives to transfusion,
opportunity to ask questions, and the right to accept or refuse
transfusions.24 However, what physicians say and what patients understand
during the consent process may be insufficient to ensure true informed
consent.25 Hospital transfusion practice committees should ensure that
consent forms for surgical and invasive procedures do not substitute for a
separate transfusion consent form, that a person with limited education can
comprehend the consent form, and that other resources are available and
used to help patients understand the risks, benefits, and alternatives to
transfusion and should audit the consent process by direct observation.
Mislabeled Type and Screen Samples
In order to protect patients from acute or delayed hemolytic transfusion
reactions by providing type-specific red cells, plasma, and platelets, blood
banks have zero tolerance for receiving a mislabeled type and screen
specimen for the intended recipient, that is, “wrong blood in tube (WBIT),”
which occurs once in every 2000–3000 collections.26 Requiring a second
signature on the type and screen tube from a caretaker who witnessed
patient identification, blood collection, and tube labeling does not prevent
WBIT incidents.27 Successful efforts to reduce this critical error include:
Independent collection of a second tube of blood and requiring
identical type results before issuing nonemergent blood requests.28
Using bar code and radiofrequency technology and software to identify
the patient, identifiers on the tube label, and the person collecting the
blood.26
Blood Bank Mistakes
Errors can occur at many points within the blood bank, but surveys
consistently show that most clinically important errors are preanalytical and
postanalytical.29 Blood bank managers and directors monitor many quality
metrics (Table 28-6), including turnaround times to deliver blood products
to operating rooms and trauma patients. FDA-licensed software products
are critical tools for efficient and safe blood bank operations and must have
the capability of linking to LIS and EMRs to provide blood utilization
reports by service and clinician to support a comprehensive blood
management program.
TABLE 28-6 Quality Metrics for Transfusion Medicine Service
After blood products leave the blood bank, there are specific storage and
transportation QC requirements to maintain quality and safety.
Transfusing a Patient
Ensuring the right blood product is transfused into the right patient is
critically important. Yet, this is another step where human errors occur due
to incorrect identification of patients and blood product labels. Successful
error reduction interventions include bar code and radiofrequency tag
technologies to prompt and document necessary identification steps26,30 and
containers for blood units with mechanical barrier systems that require a
code to unlock.26
Nursing and transfusion medicine policies and procedures provide
guidance and instructions for patient identification, rate of transfusion,
monitoring intervals, and suspecting and managing a transfusion reaction,
beginning with stopping the transfusion if not complete and returning the
residual product to the blood bank for confirmatory typing, inspection for
hemolysis, and possible culturing for bacterial contamination. All
transfusion reactions are reviewed by a pathologist or blood bank director to
determine likely causes and steps to prevent recurrent reactions (Table 28-
7).

Total Quality Management
In order to monitor and achieve safety and quality management goals, many
hospital clinicians and administrators:
Provide leadership and resources to support blood management
programs.
Employ transfusion safety officers, typically nurses with transfusion
therapy experience, to educate, audit, and report on quality and safety
indicators encompassing the entire blood transfusion chain.
Use standardized quality indicators and reports to share performance
and identify opportunities for improvement through multicenter
hemovigilance programs.
Anatomic Pathology: Specimen Integrity
and Diagnostic Accuracy
By examining cytology, biopsy, and surgical resection specimens, anatomic
pathologists produce diagnostic and prognostic information to guide patient
management decisions. Unlike the quantitative data from other clinical
laboratories, the output from anatomic pathologists is the result of a
complex qualitative process involving interpretation of clinical and
morphologic information and consisting of three components: diagnostic
accuracy, complete and clear reporting, and timely delivery. Pathologists
apply quality management systems to monitor the preanalytical, analytical,
and postanalytical stages of their diagnostic services to prevent, detect, and
correct both individual and process errors. Some quality metrics are
mandated by regulatory and accreditation organizations31 while others are
defined by local practice performance and case mix.32,33
SOURCES OF PREANALYTICAL
ERRORS
Collaboration and communication between pathologists and clinical staff
are crucial to identify and correct preanalytical deficiencies.
Collection
Pathologists rely on clinical colleagues to obtain adequate
specimens, 
to 
correctly 
label 
specimen 
containers 
and
requisitions, and to place them in the correct transport medium.
Direct communication between pathologists and clinicians during
specimen collection minimizes errors.
Pathologists need sufficient anatomic and clinical information
from clinicians accompanying specimens in order to provide
optimal diagnostic information.
Delivery: Delays or temperature extremes during transport of
specimens from patient to the pathology department can degrade
biologic material and diminish its diagnostic usefulness.
Accession: Handling and labeling errors in the pathology department
during gross specimen identification and preparation for analysis are
uncommon but grievous since most specimens are irreplaceable. The
introduction of bar coding tracking systems can reduce many in-
laboratory errors.34
SOURCES 
OF 
ANALYTICAL
ERRORS
Specimen Processing
Specimens undergo multiple preparation steps prior to analysis by
pathologists, which require quality monitoring. The major functions include
the following:
Frozen section preparation for intraoperative consultation: to
distinguish benign from malignant for a mass, tissue margins, or
regional lymph node
Histology: embedding tissue in paraffin blocks and subsequent cutting
and staining of tissue sections
Cytology: fixation and staining of Pap smear, non-GYN fluid, or fine-
needle aspiration specimens
Special 
processing: 
immunohistochemical 
staining, 
molecular
diagnostic testing, and whole slide digital imaging35
Diagnostic Accuracy
Long-term clinical follow-up to confirm many pathologic diagnoses is
impractical.
Interobserver agreement between pathologists (precision) is an
acceptable substitute for monitoring the accuracy of diagnoses and is a
crucial component of a pathology department quality improvement
program. When pathologists reviewed surgical pathology cases they signed
out >1 year ago, the intraobserver major error rate was 0.9%,35 which can
serve as a benchmark for comparison of interobserver disagreement rates.
There is no consensus on the optimal system for pathologist peer review
of cytology and surgical pathology diagnoses or on definitions for types of
interobserver disagreements. Nevertheless, recent retrospective studies have
reported disagreement rates of 7–9%32,33 and an estimate that 1% of
diagnostic discrepancies could cause patient harm.33
Surgical pathology groups develop diagnostic accuracy quality
assurance policies customized to their case mix and past experience.
Components of quality assurance programs for pathologic diagnostic
accuracy can include:
Random review of a percentage of all cases.
Selective review of paired GYN cytology and subsequent excised
tissue diagnoses, paired frozen section and permanent section
diagnoses, all cancer specimens, all specimens from tissues with
recognized higher diagnosis discordant rates (breast, GYN, prostate).
Blind review to prevent knowledge of the original diagnosis from
biasing the reviewer.
Rapid review prior to or <48 hours after sign out to reduce potential
clinical consequences.
Inclusion of negative (normal) cases to identify false-positive errors.
The frequency and types of corrected pathology reports must be
monitored. The reasons for corrections may be minor (typographical
error) or major (benign diagnosis changed to malignant diagnosis after
review or additional stains). Keep in mind that even “minor” errors
such as mistaking right for left can have catastrophic consequences for
the patient.
Postanalytical Sources of Errors
Completeness of pathology reports: This is critical for cancer staging
and must meet the standards set by the American College of Surgeons
Commission on Cancer. The quality assurance benchmark is ≥90% of
cancer-related reports will contain all required elements for optimal
pathologic diagnosis and staging.
Timeliness of results: For intraoperative pathology consultation review
of a frozen section, the benchmark is completion of 90% of cases
within 20 minutes.
Surgical pathology sign-out times are highly dependent on the type and
complexity of the case, the need for special testing (decalcification,
immunohistochemistry), and the practice setting (private practice vs.
academic practice). The College of American Pathologists has not
mandated specific turnaround time guidelines, but diagnoses should be
available in a sufficient time to provide optimal patient care for a
specific medical community.
Clarity of report: Pathologists must provide information in a format
which will be unambiguous to clinicians.
Fidelity of electronic transmission of anatomic pathology results:
Pathology departments must periodically confirm reports in
downstream EMR repositories are complete and accurate, as well as
rapidly investigate of feedback from clinicians about “dropped”
reports indicating an interface failure.
Surveys indicate clinicians are confident in the diagnostic accuracy of
their anatomic pathology colleagues while areas cited for improvement
include delays in reporting results.36
KEY POINTS
While 
clinical 
laboratory 
medical 
directors, 
managers, 
and
technologists are solely responsible for performance, interpretation,
and reporting of laboratory tests, they must also be champions for
quality management of pre- and postanalytical processes, which is
where the majority of errors occur, and optimal utilization of
laboratory resources.
While blood safety has improved dramatically due to donor
selection and testing strategies, transfusion safety risks persist due to
both biologic complications and human errors—especially mislabeling
of type and screen specimens and transfusing blood products to the
wrong patient. While technologic advances are reducing human errors,

patient safety will be further improved by minimizing transfusions
through effective blood management programs.
In addition to the quality metrics that apply to clinical laboratories,
anatomic pathologists must continuously monitor the accuracy of their
cytology and surgical pathology diagnoses thru peer review of selected
cases.

29 Medication Safety
Thomas M. De Fer
CLINICAL VIGNETTE
A thin and frail 76-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease
and prior stent placement at an outside hospital is admitted via the
emergency department after a 25-minute episode of chest pain. It is decided
that a cardiac catheterization should be performed. She also reports a vague
history of contrast allergy and cannot provide further details due to poor
memory. The contrast allergy pretreatment order set is prescribed by the
cardiologist, and it consists of prednisone 50 mg at 13, 7, and 1 hour
preprocedure, diphenhydramine 50 mg at 7 and 1 hour preprocedure, and
ranitidine 150 mg at 7 and 1 hour preprocedure. She receives all of the
premedications as ordered, but at 5:00 pm the catheterization is canceled
due to an emergency case. She is rescheduled for tomorrow at 10:00 am;
therefore, the pretreatment protocol is ordered again. Transport arrives at
10:00 am and finds the patient lying on the floor mumbling about having to
go to the bathroom and with a 5-cm laceration on her forehead. A cause
mapping analysis determines that the multiple doses of diphenhydramine
over a short period of time were the primary contributing factor of this
adverse event.
What other factors contributed to this error?
How should this error be categorized?
How might this error have been prevented?
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Medication errors are defined as “any preventable event that may cause or
lead to inappropriate medication use or patient harm while the medication is
in the control of the health care professional, patient, or consumer. Such
events may be related to professional practice, health care products,
procedures, and systems, including prescribing, order communication,
product labeling, packaging, and nomenclature, compounding, dispensing,
distribution, administration, education, monitoring, and use.”1 About 1% of
medication errors result in patient harm.2
Adverse drug events (ADEs) are any adverse occurrence related to the
administration of medication, whether or not an error occurred.
Preventable ADEs are those that reach the patient and are due to
medical error. Potential ADEs are those errors that were discovered
before reaching the patient. They are frequently called near misses.
Those ADEs that are not due to medical error and are nonpreventable
are typically called adverse drug reactions (ADRs). A colloquial term for
ADRs is side effects, though this implies that they are all negative and
unintended. Type A ADRs are the most common. They are predictable, due
to the pharmacologic properties of the drug in question, and are often dose
dependent. For example, anticholinergics cause sleepiness and nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs cause dyspepsia. Type B ADRs are less common
and are unpredictable. Idiosyncratic and immunologically mediated
(allergic) reactions are included here. There are some idiosyncratic
reactions for which the mechanism is known (e.g., hemolytic anemia in a
patient 
treated 
with 
nitrofurantoin 
due 
to 
glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase deficiency), but more often, it is unclear (e.g., clozapine-
induced agranulocytosis). Type B ADRs usually produce signs and
symptoms that are unrelated to the pharmacologic properties of the drug.
An exception, also included in this group, is patients with unique
intolerance to a drug even at low doses; the classic example being one
aspirin pill causing tinnitus. Figure 29-1 illustrates the relationship between
medication errors, ADEs, and ADRs.3–9
Figure 29-1 Medication errors, ADEs, and ADRs. ADE, adverse drug
event; NSAID, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug; TCA, tricyclic
antidepressant.
(Adapted from Gandhi TK, Seger DL, Bates DW. Identifying drug safety issues from research to
practice. Int J Qual Health Care. 2000;12:69–76.)
The magnitude and scope of medication errors are troublingly large, and
they contribute very significantly to the overall rate of medical errors.
ADEs are thought to account for about 700,000 emergency department
visits and result in 100,000 hospitalizations per year.8,9 At least 400,000
ADEs occur during hospitalizations yearly and are estimated to cost $3.5
billion (in 2006 dollars).10,11 The overall inpatient preventable ADE rate is
approximately 2.4–6.5 per 100 admissions.10–12 One study did report a
much higher rate of 52 per 100 admissions.13 ADE rates may be higher in
intensive care unit settings.14 Likewise, over half a million ADEs occur in
the ambulatory setting and upward of 800,000 in long-term care facilities
annually.10,15,16
One out of 131 (0.8%) outpatient deaths and 1 out of 854 (0.1%)
inpatient deaths are attributable to medication errors—this amounts to more
than 7000 deaths per year.17 Overall, data suggest that the rate of fatal
medication errors has increased; this is particularly true in the domestic
setting and when alcohol and street drugs are involved.18 Rates may
increase significantly at the beginning of the academic year in counties with
teaching hospitals as opposed to those without.19
Multiple patient-based risk factors for ADEs have been identified by
various studies. Increasing age is a consistent finding. Taking multiple
medications has also frequently been associated with ADEs. Commonly
cited medications include anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, insulin, and
oral hypoglycemics. High-risk medications designated by the Institute for
Safe Medication Practices (ISMP) are presented in Table 29-1.20 Other
suggested risk factors are listed in Figure 29-1.3–9,15,16

CATEGORIZING 
MEDIATION
ERRORS
Medication errors can be categorized in multiple ways including
psychological domain, harm score, type of error, process step involved, and
proximal causes. Each has its advantages and disadvantages. Psychological
theory attempts to explain the way adverse events occur and has been
applied to a broad range of medical errors.21 Some medication errors are
termed mistakes and result from knowledge-based errors or rule-based
errors. Others are skill-based errors, which result from action-based
errors (slips) or memory-based errors (lapses). Understanding the
psychological basis of an error informs the process of reducing its
recurrence.
A commonly used harm scoring system is that of National
Coordinating Council for Medication Error Reporting and Prevention. This
scale (Fig. 29-2) ranges from the potential for error, no harm, temporary
harm, permanent harm, and death across nine-lettered categories, A to I.22
The regular use of a clear, consistent, and workable harm scoring system is
critical to the tracking of medication errors.
Figure 29-2 Medication error categories. (Adapted from National
Coordinating Council for Medication Error Reporting and Prevention. NCC
MERP Index for Categorizing Medication Errors. 2001. Available at:
http://www.nccmerp.org/types-medication-errors. Last accessed 10/1/15.)
The administration of any type of medication to patients takes place over
multiple process steps (Fig. 29-3):
Figure 29-3 Potential error types by process step.
1. Prescribing: The prescription process is complex and involves all of the
cognitive effort of the prescriber to determine whether to prescribe (or
not), what precisely to prescribe, the dose, formulation, route, timing,
and frequency of the chosen drug, and the process of formulating this
information into a verbal, written, or electronic prescription. Individual
patient factors such as renal and hepatic function, allergies, and drug–
drug interactions must also be taken into account.
2. Transcribing: Transcription happens at any point where an
order/prescription, be it electronic or handwritten, is interpreted by
another health care professional and handwritten or electronically
entered into a different system. Poor handwriting contributes greatly to
errors in this step.
3. Dispensing: Medication dispensing is largely a function of the
pharmacy staff. Interpretation of prescriptions, rechecking for allergies
and drug–drug interaction, retrieval of the medication from its place of
storage, counting, bottling, labeling, and, sometimes, compounding are
all involved. In the inpatient setting, the process may also involve
stocking unit-based medication storage and dispensing devices.
4. Administration: The administration step is also multifaceted. Nurses
must determine who requires what medication when using the
medication administration record (MAR). Medications must be
retrieved from storage and safely transported to the site of
administration. The patient must be positively identified and the
opportunity to check for allergies presents itself once again. The
medication is then given to the patient. If the medication is IV, for
example, more steps are involved and, therefore, there are more
opportunities for error.
Each one of these surprisingly complex process steps can be broken down
into multiple subprocesses—this is often necessary in order to design less
error-prone systems. Other important steps that do not necessarily fit into a
chronological sequence are storage, monitoring, and documentation.
Problems at any point in the process chain have the potential to result
in a preventable ADE.
Commonly accepted types of medication errors are as follows:
Missed dose: Standards vary from institution to institution as to what
constitutes a missed dose. A stringent inpatient definition would be
>0.5–1 hour past the scheduled admiration time. A more realistic
definition, particularly in the outpatient setting, would be greater than
half the prescribed dosing interval. Of course, some medications are
quite time sensitive, while others are not. Some institutions will have
an intermediate category called late dose.
Extra dose: Typically, an extra dose occurs when a provider is not
aware that a preceding provider has already given the intended dose,
which could be due to a handoff and/or documentation issue.
Wrong dose: Incorrect quantity of the medication is given.
Wrong rate is a variation of wrong dose that applies to IV
medications, which occurs when the wrong volume (quantity) per unit
time is entered into the pump.
Likewise, wrong concentration is also a variation of wrong dose and
can result in under- or overdosing.
Wrong form: For example, an order for IV morphine is entered and
oral morphine gel is drawn into a syringe and given IV.
Wrong route: An extended release tablet is intended to be given PO;
instead, it is crushed and administered via a gastrostomy tube.
Wrong frequency/timing: An intravenous antibiotic is prescribed as
every 18 hours but is given every 24 hours.
Wrong drug: A particular medication is intended for a patient, but
during removal from storage, the incorrect medication is retrieved and
subsequently given to the patient. In other words, the wrong drug is
given to the right patient. This can occur at either the dispensing or
administration step.
Wrong patient: This occurs when the correct medication is obtained
and intended to be given to the corresponding patient, but at the point
of administration, the patient is misidentified resulting in the right
medicine being given to the wrong patient.
Known allergy: A medication to which the patient has a documented
allergy is nonetheless given. This technically excludes a conscious,
reasoned decision by the clinician to disregard an allergy, for example,
cefazolin is purposefully prescribed for a patient with a documented
penicillin allergy.
A Food and Drug Administration (FDA) study found that between 1993 and
1998, the most common types of fatal ADEs were wrong dose (41%),
wrong drug (16%), and wrong route (9.7%). Nearly half of these fatal
events happened in patients >60 years old.23 Extrapolating these data to
nonfatal ADEs and across all care settings is difficult. The most common
errors seen depend on the severity of harm and the characteristics of
caregivers and patients in a given environment. As an example, the most
common medication error overall in acute care inpatient settings is likely to
be missed/late dose, which results in no harm to the patient the large
majority of the time. In the outpatient setting, patient-driven errors (e.g.,
missed doses, extra doses, wrong doses) will be more prominent. Types of
errors according to process step are presented in Figure 29-3.
CAUSES 
OF 
MEDICATION
ERRORS
Regardless of the process step or type of error, health care providers are
often most interested in the so-called proximal causes.24,25 Determining
cause can be challenging in individual situations, and most often, there are
multiple causes and contributing factors. As with any other type of medical
error, some factors are active while others are latent. Proximal causes
crosscut process steps and health care provider roles. The following is not
intended to be an exhaustive list:
Lack of knowledge regarding a drug and lack of readily available,
accurate drug/prescribing information. This can be a limitation for both
the prescriber and the individual administering the medication. It is
simply not possible for physicians, pharmacists, and nurses to be
familiar with all of the >16,000 FDA-approved prescription drug
products available in the US (including all dosages, forms, and
generics).26

alter
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, such as renal function,
hepatic function, obesity, and age. In older adults, absorption may be
slower, the ratio of fat to lean mass increases, phase I metabolism is
slower, excretion may be slower, and the pharmacodynamics of some
drugs are altered.
Lack of immediate availability of patient-specific information that
may alter prescribing such as laboratory results concerning renal and
hepatic function or parameters such as weight and body mass index.
Patient mis-/nonidentification.
Lack of monitoring, for example, coagulation parameters in patients
receiving anticoagulants and certain antibiotic or anticonvulsant levels.
Use of ambiguous abbreviations, be they in handwritten or electronic
format (Table 29-2).27
Sound-alike/look-alike medications can easily be confused (Table 29-
3).28
Illegible handwriting remains an issue as computerized order entry
has not been deployed in many care settings.
Failure of communication and teamwork.
Medication mis-/nonreconciliation at care transitions, which are
known to be vulnerable times for medication errors. Reconciliation is
“the process of creating the most accurate list possible of all
medications a patient is taking—including drug name, dosage,
frequency, and route—and comparing that list against the physician's
admission, transfer, and/or discharge orders, with the goal of providing
correct medications to the patient at all transition points.”29 Studies
have demonstrated high rates of unintended variances (approximately
50–60%) and potential ADEs (approximately 20–30%).30–33
Medication mis-/nonidentification. Many pills and much packaging
look very similar.
Improper storage, for example, visually very similar bags of
dopamine and dobutamine solutions being stored in immediate
physical proximity or lack of refrigeration where required.
Lack of standardization, such as failing to have an enforce standard
concentrations of IV vasopressors and heparin solutions.
Supply chain changes, which can result in drug packaging appearing
suddenly different from prior resulting in confusion during dispensing
and administration.
Environmental factors such as noise, lighting, physical layout of the
pharmacy, cluttered work areas, interruptions, high patient acuity, and
staffing.
Provider factors such as fatigue, long work hours, stress, hunger,
illness, boredom, and substance use.
Lack of competence/training operating new and/or complex
administration devices. The newest, most sophisticated, and expensive
delivery devices are useless (or worse) without proper training.
Lack of administration device standardization and administration
device failure. If, for example, patient-controlled analgesia delivery
devices differ across care units in the same institution, it is unlikely
that any single nurse will be competent in operating all of them.
Computer system inadequacy and malfunction are likely to become
more significant factors as the US health care system continues to
become more and more dependent on electronic documentation,
prescribing, and administration systems.
Inadequate, conflicting, or lack of allergy documentation.
Poor/nonexistent patient education. It is worth remembering that
patients administer their own medications at home and that process is
directly analogous to what happens in the hospital; therefore, it is
vulnerable to similar causes of error. In this context, patient education
is vital.

DETECTING 
AND 
TRACKING
MEDICATION ERRORS
Systematic methods to detect, track, and investigate medication errors are
critical components of an overall plan to maximize medication safety. In
order to capture as many medication errors as possible, multiple methods of
detection are required including25:
1. Voluntary anonymous self-reports. One possible advantages of this
method is that anonymity circumvents reporter concerns of
disciplinary action/reprisal, whether he or she committed or witnessed
the error. Anonymity greatly inhibits subsequent follow-up and
investigation of the error. On the other hand, an anonymous report is
better than no report at all. A robust culture of safety should
theoretically reduce the perceived need for anonymous reporting.
2. Voluntary nonanonymous reports/incident reports. In an ideal
culture of safety, all medication errors (including potential ADEs)
would be reported voluntarily and nonanonymously. As previously
noted, however, medication errors are very underreported. Reports of
error (including anonymous ones) should contain at minimum:
identifying patient information, the drug involved, what happened,
speculation as to why it happened, any additional monitoring or testing
required, and any additional therapy needed to prevent or treat patient
harm. In most organizations, this process is electronic and leads
reporters through a standard template.
3. Computer-assisted monitoring.34–36 Many institutions use computer
systems to monitor for errors at multiple points in the process
including 
prescribing, 
order 
verification, 
dispensing, 
and
administration. For example, measures of renal function can be used as
triggers with regard to use of specified renally cleared medications.
Any order for naloxone can alert to a possible error in the use of an
opiate. Likewise, any severe hypoglycemia may indicate inappropriate
use of insulin or oral hypoglycemics. Many potential drug–drug
interactions can be tracked in this way. While currently imperfect,
computerized ADE monitoring detects more errors than voluntary
reporting and has the potential to intercept significant ADEs.
4. Chart review is more often a research technique, but individuals who
routinely review charts (e.g., billing/coding and health information
management personnel) can be trained to detect medication errors.
5. Direct observation is also generally a research technique. It can detect
more errors but is time consuming and expensive.
Medication error data should be compiled and analyzed systematically, and
this is often done by safety and quality professionals along pharmacy
personnel. Very clear lines of communication and involvement of
physicians and staff are also necessary. Overall error rates (e.g., events per
1000 patient days) are typically followed using standard run charts.
Different charts can be scaled to best display rates and control limits of
potential errors (A), errors with no harm (B, C, D), errors with harm (E, F,
G, H), and errors with death (I). Rates can vary quite a bit over time and are
often due to variations in reporting rather than true changes in rate. More
complex graphical representations that display numbers of types of errors
(e.g., missed dose, wrong dose, etc.) by process step can be very helpful
(Fig. 29-4). For example, missed dose errors due to dispensing or
administration issues will likely require rather different strategies to
ameliorate.
Figure 29-4 Occurrence of error types by process step.
MITIGATION STRATEGIES
No individual mitigation strategy is capable of addressing all sources of
error. Therefore, meaningful reductions in medication error rates require
strategies that involve the individual providers (physician, pharmacist,
pharmacy technician, nurse, and patient) and the system as a whole. A
sound culture of safety is an absolutely necessary foundation for these
strategies to have their maximal impact.
Health Care Provider Strategies
The rights of safe prescribing remain entirely relevant and are presented
in Table 29-4. These include the right patient, drug, dose, route, frequency,
and duration. Right monitoring implies, for example, coagulation testing for
patients taking certain anticoagulants, drug level monitoring when
appropriate, awareness of and observation for known side effects, etc. Right
cost asks the prescriber to consider if an equally efficacious drug is
available for a lower price. Extra care and vigilance are necessary whenever
prescribing an ISMP-designated high-risk medication (Table 29-1).20
Drug–drug interactions should always be considered and the possibility of
such an interaction increases with number of medications prescribed.
Prescribers should be educated regarding commonly implicated medications
(e.g., warfarin, macrolide antibiotics, sulfa drugs, amiodarone, azole
antifungals, protease inhibitors, etc.) and use interaction software liberally.
Appropriate dose adjustments should be made for renal and hepatic
dysfunction when necessary. Where electronic prescribing is not available,
it is clearly the prescriber's responsibility to write legibly and avoid the
use of disallowed abbreviations (Table 29-2).27
TABLE 29-4 The Rs of Safe Prescribing and Administration
Particular attention should be paid to prescribing for children and the
elderly. Dosing in children very frequently requires dosage calculations
based on patient-specific parameters (e.g., weight, height, body mass index,
body surface area). Such information must be readily available in a
standardized format (e.g., always kilograms instead of pounds), and
prescribers should have easy access to methods of calculating dose.
Difficult or high-risk calculations should be verified by others. Additionally,
many medications commonly used in adults are not approved and/or unsafe
for children.
The elderly are subject to more ADEs as well and mindfulness in
prescribing is necessary. Certain medications have been designated as
potentially inappropriate for older adults, the most well-known list being
the American Geriatrics Society Beers Criteria (Table 29-5).37–41 While
not absolutely contraindicated in every situation, careful consideration
should occur prior to starting any of them in older patients. The Screening
Tool of Older Persons' potentially inappropriate Prescriptions (STOPP)
criteria may be more effective at preventing avoidable ADEs.42
Polypharmacy is a particular problem in the elderly. Physicians should
avoid prescribing an additional medication to counteract the side effects
presumably due to another, leading to a so-called prescribing cascade.43
Efforts should be made to discontinue drugs that do not have an evidence-
based or reasonably valid indication, particularly when possible ADEs/side
effects are not clearly outweighed.44

Other than the outpatient setting, nurses are the primary actors of the
administration process step. It is the last opportunity to intercept errors that
have occurred upstream and gone undetected. The rights are no less
important here (i.e., right patient, drug, dose, route, and time). In many
instances, there are other policy-based actions that must also occur at the
time of administration (e.g., tracing the line for IV infusions). As discussed
in Causes of Medication Errors, many factors may impact on an individual
nurse's ability to perform flawlessly at this critical point.
System Strategies
Computerized provider order entry (CPOE) systems, sometimes
accompanied by varying degrees of clinic decision support systems
(CDSS), are now becoming much more common. Such systems may be a
component of an all-encompassing electronic health record but sometimes
not. Systems may be large commercial ventures or single institution-only
locally developed ones. Either way, they are extraordinarily expensive and
labor intensive to implement and maintain. Nevertheless, CPOE systems
have the potential to substantially reduce ADEs. Individual studies of CPOE
with or without CDSS have demonstrated reductions in medication error
rates, and a smaller number have shown decreases in ADEs.45–49 Results
may not be broadly applicable across systems and sites of care. A few
studies point to unintended negative consequences of CPOE.50,51 The
proper balance of number/types of alerts versus perceived positive effects of
such alerts is a major issue for busy clinicians. Much remains to be learned
in order to maximize the effectiveness of these systems.
Similarly, smart pumps have much potential. These devices have
software allowing for drug-specific infusions, on-board rate calculations,
alerts/warnings (soft stops), and hard stops. Some smart pumps have
scanning technology to confirm the identity of IV solutions. They may have
the capability of wirelessly updating libraries and downloading information
regarding key strokes, bypassed alerts, etc. Unfortunately, this expensive
technology has yet to live up to its potential. There are frequent and easy
opportunities to bypass safeguards, particularly ignoring alerts/soft stops.
Even hard stops can be bypassed, for example, by programming a pump as
a normal saline solution rather than a heparin solution. At present, the
typical smart pump is not assigned to a particular patient and does not
interface with an electronic MAR. In other words, the pump is only smart
enough to know that a provider has indicated which drug is to be given and
the general administration rules that have been uploaded for that drug.
Failures to standardize IV medication concentrations, update drug libraries,
and implement hard stops are other important issues.52 Notwithstanding, the
potential remains and continued work is needed to realize the benefits of
smart pumps.
Bar coding is also a technology that has a high degree of face validity.
As would be expected, patients and medications are bar coded and these
codes interface with the appropriate MAR. Patient and drug are scanned at
the point of administration to confirm that drug X is on patient Y's MAR
and is due at the present time. A study of over 14,000 medication
administrations demonstrated a 41.4% relative reduction in medication
errors and a 50.8% relative reduction in potential ADEs with the use of bar
coding technology. These rates exclude timing errors and the absolute
reduction in potential ADEs was 1.5%.53 An earlier study by the same
group also demonstrated significant reductions in potential ADEs with the
use of bar code technology during pharmacy dispensing.54
Medication reconciliation issues are well known to be associated with
medication errors.30–33 The Joint Commission includes medication
reconciliation in its current national patient safety goals, essentially
requiring hospital organizations to demonstrate that it is occurring in a
systematic and effect manner. This too remains a work in progress with
substantial potential to reduce errors. Reviews on the subject have generally
agreed that results have been mixed regarding clinically important
outcomes and that more rigorously designed research is needed.55–59 It is
likely that medication reconciliation is just one component of effective care
transitions. Having an accurate and readily accessible electronic repository
of allergy documentation is also imperative. Ideally, it would cut across
multiple sites of care and interact directly with CPOE, dispensing, and bar
coding systems to alert providers at multiple process steps. Unfortunately, it
is not rare for patients to unintentionally receive a medication to which they
have a documented allergy.
The inclusion of clinical pharmacists on inpatient services is likely to
improve patient care. More than half of studies have demonstrated
reductions in errors, ADEs, and ADRs.60 While it is entirely reasonable to
suppose that pharmacists would be ideal individuals to perform medication
reconciliations, at least one recent trial failed to show an effect.61 Other
pharmacy-based strategies include the use of tall man lettering for sound-
alike/look-alike drugs (Table 29-3), automated storage and retrieval
systems, unit-based storage and dispensing systems, IV compounding
workflow management systems, and robotic prescription dispensing
devices.28
KEY POINTS
Medication errors and adverse drug events are common in all care
settings, result in approximately 100,000 hospitalizations per year
and are very costly.
Medication errors are underreported.
Medication errors can be categorized by psychological theory,
process step, proximal cause, and degree of patient harm.
Health care organizations must have functional and transparent
methods of reporting, detecting, tracking, and analyzing
medication errors.
Multiple mitigation strategies exist, but no single strategy will
eliminate all errors.

Readmissions
Emily Fondahn and Elna Nagasako
CLINICAL VIGNETTE
Mrs. H is a 72-year-old widowed woman with type 2 diabetes,
hypertension, and hyperlipidemia who initially presented to the hospital
with severe chest pain. She was diagnosed with a non–ST elevation
myocardial infarction and underwent a coronary catheterization with
placement of two drug-eluding stents. She tolerated the procedure well and
had no complications during her hospital stay. She went home with a list of
new prescriptions, including clopidogrel. She was unable to drive to the
pharmacy for 3 days due to feeling weak and had no one at home to help
her. When she went to pick up her new medications, she was unable to
afford clopidogrel. She was too embarrassed to call her physician and tell
him that she was not taking the medication. Ten days after she was
discharged, she again began experiencing severe chest pain and returned to
the hospital. She was readmitted and diagnosed with an ST elevation
myocardial infarction and new heart failure due to in-stent stenosis from not
taking her clopidogrel.
What factors led her to being readmitted to the hospital?
How could her readmission for a myocardial infarction and heart
failure have been prevented?
INTRODUCTION
Recently, hospital readmissions have been highlighted as an indicator of
poor quality of care and high costs within the health care system. Currently,
1 out of 5 Medicare beneficiaries are readmitted within 30 days with an
estimated cost of 17.5 billion dollars!1 While some readmissions reflect
worsening of disease, many are a result of an uncoordinated and confusing
discharge process for patients or incomplete treatment of an illness.
Increased emphasis is being placed on hospitals to redesign their models for
transitions of care into a more patient-centered process. Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) have begun penalizing hospitals
with an excess rate of readmissions. Hospitals are currently being penalized
based on readmission rates for congestive heart failure, pneumonia, acute
myocardial infarction, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation,
elective total hip arthroplasty, and elective total knee arthroplasty.2
CMS defines a transition of care as “The movement of a patient from
one setting of care (hospital, ambulatory primary care practice, ambulatory
specialty care practice, long-term care, home health, rehabilitation facility)
to another.” These care transitions usually mean a change of health care
providers which predisposes patients to fragmentation of care. Especially in
elderly or chronically ill patients, multiple providers and care settings may
be involved, which can quickly become confusing and overwhelming for a
patient or caregiver to navigate. Currently, there are few incentives for
providers to take on the task of care coordination and no specific person or
group in the health care setting is responsible for coordinating postdischarge
care. Patients are often discharged into a “gray zone” where no one provider
will assume responsibility for their care. The current gaps in the system can
be viewed as hospital care systems issues, patient-related issues, and
clinician-related issues.3 The deficiencies within the hospital system include
poor communication to the outpatient provider, inadequate patient
information, medication errors, lack of timely follow-up, and lapse in home
services. Patient-specific factors consist of development of new medical
problems, worsening of previous problem, addiction issues, language and/or
cultural issues, medication adherence, and follow-up. The clinician-specific
issues consist of inappropriate discharge of a patient, inappropriate
medications, inadequate home services, or errors in ordering, seeing, or
acting upon a laboratory or test result. Each of these deficiencies represents
as possible area to improve transitions of care and reduce preventable
readmissions.
HIGH-RISK PATIENTS
Identifying patients at high risk for readmission and adverse events is a
critical step in improving care transitions. Identification allows for better
use of resources and tailored interventions. Risk assessment tools are
available and generally include areas such as previous admissions,
diagnoses, and age. Social and cultural factors can also play a key role in
making a patient high risk, such as having a poor support system or not
speaking English. In addition, cognitive impairment, poor health literacy,
and low self-efficacy are other important nonclinical risk factors, which are
often underrecognized by clinicians but impact a patient's ability to
remember and follow discharge instructions.4 These patients may be labeled
as “noncompliant” by the health care team but really require simplification
of traditional discharge materials and more support from family members or
caregivers. Project BOOST (Better Outcomes for Older Adults Through
Safe Transitions), a national initiative to improve care transitions led by the
Society for Hospital Medicine, has developed the 8P screening tool as a
quick, easy way to identify high-risk patients (Table 30-1).5 These risk
factors can be used in conjunction with targeted interventions.

COMMUNICATION 
DURING
TRANSITIONS OF CARE
Communication with Primary Care Provider
Communication of a hospital course to the primary care provider is a
critically important step in the discharge process. The hospital discharge
summary serves as a traditional mode of communication between the
inpatient and outpatient providers, which should provide a summary of the
hospital course, significant findings, pending test results, and patient status
(Table 30-2). However, adequate communication between inpatient and
outpatient teams occurs infrequently. In one systematic review, Kripalani et
al. found that direct communication between the hospital physician and
primary care physicians was rare, occurring in between 3% and 20% of
encounters, and that the primary care physicians had the discharge summary
available at only 12–34% of postdischarge visits.6 Additionally, even when
a discharge summary was available for a provider, key information was
often missing. Improving information exchange leads to improved
continuity of care, hospital use, patient status, primary care use, and
decreases errors, near misses, or adverse events.8 These gaps in
communication lead to confusion for the patient and the providers and
could be a potential course of adverse events and readmissions.

COMMUNICATING 
WITH
PATIENTS
Discharge Instructions
Traditional discharge instructions can be confusing and overwhelming for
patients. Even patients with adequate health literacy may not be able to
process all the information provided due to illness, stress, or excitement
about going home. In one study of patients 70 years or older interviewed 3
days after discharge, over half (54.2%) did not recall having someone talk
to them about how to care for themselves after hospitalization and only
27% had a telephone name or number to call if they needed help after
returning home.9 Patients then leave the hospital confused about how to
manage their care when they arrive home. Additionally, the patient may not
be the ideal learner in the hospital environment. It is imperative to identify
the best person to receive the teaching, then provide him or her with the
essential information that they need. Some patients and caregivers may not
learn the best with written instructions; in those cases, it is important to ask
how the patient or caregiver learns best and tailor the discharge education.
Furthermore, the written discharge instructions should be provided in a
patient-centered format. General principles include using large font (at least
12 point), writing in a sixth grade or below reading level, using upper- and
lowercase text, using bulleted lists or short paragraphs, and avoiding
information overload.10
These are the key components of discharge
instructions:
Reason for hospitalization (written in patient-friendly terminology)
Medication list
Potential side effects of medications
Name and phone number of a person to call if problems arise
Symptoms to watch out for
How to keep health problems from getting worse
Follow-up appointments for tests and clinical visits with dates, times,
location, and contact number
Diet
Activity level
Disease-specific instructions
Medication errors are one of the most common problems seen when
patients leave the hospital. While inpatient, medications are frequently
stopped, started, and changed. Patients need an accurate medication list
upon discharge. Ideally, this medication list includes brand and generic
names; dose of each medication; time to take medication; new medications,
changed medications, and stopped medications; and indication for the
medicine. One effective way to communicate this information is to create a
personalized pill card or schedule (Fig. 30-1).
Figure 30-1 Personalized pill card. (Adapted from How to Create a Pill
Card. Rockville, MD: Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality; 2008.

treatment/treatments/pillcard/index.html. Accessed 12/21/15).
Teach-Backs
Teach-backs have been identified as one effective model to educate patients
and check for understanding. Patients often do not understand or remember
what is explained to them by clinicians. In essence, a teach-back helps
“close the loop” to ensure that effective communication about disease and
self-care has been communicated to the patient and/or caregivers.11 The
purpose of a teach-back is to have patients explain, in their own words,
what the clinician told them. It is not a test of patient's understanding;
rather, it is a method to check the clinician's ability to explain a concept
clearly to a patient. If a patient is unable to verbalize a correct answer, the
clinician needs to reteach the concept to the patient. Teach-back is more
effective than asking a patient “Do you understand?” since patients will
often reply “yes,” even if they are still confused. Clinicians should also
remember to use plain language, a caring tone, and short statements when
talking to patients.
Examples of teach-back questions:
“I want you to explain to me how you will take your medication, so I
can be sure I have explained everything correctly.”
“Please show me how you will use the asthma inhaler, so I can be sure
I have given you clear instructions.”
“When you get home, your spouse will ask you what the doctor said;
what will you tell your spouse?”
IMPROVING 
TRANSITIONS 
OF
CARE
With the new focus on reducing readmissions and improving transitions of
care, health care systems have started scrutinizing the discharge process and
implementing novel approaches to improve transitions of care. A variety of
strategies have been used, such as increasing the use of teach-backs,
clarifying discharge instructions, comprehensive discharge planning,
standardizing the discharge process with the use of templates or checklists,
and creating transitional care teams. Several large wide-scale models have
shown the use of these strategies to be effective in reducing readmission
rates.
DISCHARGE PLANNING
With current attempts to shorten the inpatient length of stay and increase
care provided in the ambulatory setting, more emphasis has been placed on
discharge planning. Discharge planning is creating an individualized
discharge plan for a patient prior to the patient leaving the hospital. A recent
Cochrane Review reported that tailored discharge planning can reduce
length of stay and readmission rates for individuals.12 Discharge planning
starts at admission and should be addressed throughout the hospital stay. A
multidisciplinary group, with physicians, nurses, social workers, and case
managers, can work together to identify barriers to discharge and identify
solutions to those potential barriers. Common mistakes made by the care
team in the hospital include having a poor understanding of a patient's
ability to perform self-care in the home environment, not including patients
and/or caregivers in the discharge process, transfer to a care venue that does
not meet the patient's needs, medication errors and polypharmacy,
worsening clinical status, and discharging a patient too early.13 Hospitals
often employ case managers, social workers, or dedicated discharge
planners who can screen patients that will need support with discharge
planning and assist with arranging complex discharge services. Discharge
specialists can also navigate different insurance plans to help provide
coverage for services and help arrange home services.
Components of discharge planning include:
Where patient will go after discharge (home, rehabilitation facility,
skilled nursing facility)
Any special care that will be needed (home health, home physical
therapy, hospice)
Medication reconciliation, including new and changed medications
and how a patient will obtain medications
Durable medical equipment (walkers, supplemental oxygen, hospital
bed)
Activity level
Follow-up appointments with primary care provider, specialists, and
any needed laboratory or imaging studies
Transportation 
home 
and 
to 
follow-up 
appointments 
(cabs,
ambulances, private transportation, public transportation)
Some institutions are beginning to incorporate discharge checklists for the
health care team and/or patient to ensure that all the key components of
discharge are met. These discharge checklists may be disease specific (i.e.,
congestive heart failure, acute myocardial infarction) or universal for all
patients discharged, regardless of their admitting diagnosis.
TRANSITIONAL CARE TEAMS
In order to assist patients through a smooth transition from the hospital to
home, many health care systems are developing transitional care teams.
These teams can be multidisciplinary and often led by nurses or case
coordinators. These programs are tailored to identify and monitor high-risk
patients. The transitional care nurse acts as the key contact person for the
patient. The nurse meets the patient in the hospital, coordinates discharge
care, and then follows up with the patient in the home and via telephone
calls. The transitional care nurse will also accompany the patient to
physician appointments and assist the care coordination between multiple
providers. The goal of these programs is to address a patient's concerns and
changes in health while in the outpatient setting to avoid unnecessary visits
to the emergency department or inpatient hospitalization. The transitional
care nurse can also identify and correct possible adverse events or errors,
such as noticing that a patient does not have an important medication.
Research for these programs has generally been promising in showing a
reduction in readmission rates and longer lengths of time out of the hospital
for patients.
SPECIFIC MODELS
BOOSTing Care Transitions (Better Outcomes by Optimizing Safe
Transitions) has been developed by the Society for Hospital Medicine to
provide a framework and support to improve care transitions.5 The goals of
Project BOOST were to:
1. Reduce 30-day readmission rates for general internal medicine patients
2. Improve patient satisfaction and HCAHPS scores 3. Improve
information flow between inpatient and outpatient providers 4. Identify
high-risk patients and target-specific interventions 5. Improve patient
and family preparation for discharge
Project BOOST has developed specific tools to identify high-risk patients
and standardize the discharge process. The BOOST toolkit includes of risk
stratification process (8P tool, Table 30-1), a risk-specific intervention plan,
the universal checklist, and the general assessment of preparedness (GAP)
to evaluate the readiness of patients to leave the hospital. The TARGET tool
is designed to be filled out by a multidisciplinary group, but a specific
individual should have ultimate ownership. Initial data on Project BOOST
at the six pilot sites showed a reduction in readmission rates from 14.2% to
11.2%.14
Project Re-engineered Discharge (RED) was created at Boston
University with support from the Agency for Healthcare Research and
Quality (AHRQ) and National Institutes of Health (NIH).15 Project RED
identified 12 key components for discharge and presents them in a patient-
centered manner (Table 30-3). Patients are provided with an “After Hospital
Care Plan” when they leave the hospital, which contains key information
about medications, follow-up, contact information of the primary care
physician and discharge advocate, pending lab results, reason for
hospitalization, and a calendar with scheduled tests and appointments. A
“virtual patient advocate” named Louise was invented to assist with the
discharge process. Louise simulates the patient–nurse interaction and helps
teach patients about medications, follow-up appointments, and diagnoses
through a computer touch screen display on a wheeled kiosk. In the pilot
study for Project RED, the readmission rate was reduced by 30% in the
intervention group. Patients in the intervention group also had higher rates
of follow-up with primary care physicians and reported being more
prepared for discharge.16
TABLE 30-3 Components of Project RED
(Adapted from Boston University School of Medicine. Project RED (Re-Engineered Discharge).
http://www.bu.edu/fammed/projectred/. Accessed 3/5/13).
Transitional Care Model (TCM) was created by Mary Naylor, RN, PhD,
at the University of Pennsylvania.17 This model utilizes advanced practice
nurses called Transitional Care Nurses (TCNs) to coordinate pre- and
postdischarge care in high-risk, elderly patients with chronic illness. The
TCNs are in charge of discharge planning, then follow the patients when
they return home. The TCN acts as a link between the inpatient and
outpatient setting and provides home support, close follow-up with patients,
and engagement of the patient and family. The goal is to interrupt patterns
of frequent hospital or emergency department use and prevent health
decline. Randomized trials evaluating this model have shown significant
reductions in hospital readmissions, lengthened time to first readmission,
and decreased cost of care.18
Care Transitions Program was developed by Eric Coleman, MD,
MPH. This model is a 4-week program, which focuses on improving self-
management skills with the help of a Transition Coach. The Transition
Coach follows the patient from the inpatient hospitalization to the
outpatient setting. Their role is assisting the patient in learning self-
management skills and improving patient–provider communication. The
Transition Coach teaches patients and caregivers how to respond to
problems that may occur during and after transitions. This model showed a
significant reduction in readmission rates in elderly people at 30, 90, and
180 days after discharge and a longer time until readmission.
The four components of the program are defined as the four pillars:
Medication self-management
Patient-centered record
Follow-up with physician
Knowledge of “red flags” or warning signs/symptoms and how to
respond
KEY POINTS
High readmission rates are an indicator of poor care coordination
and an area of unnecessarily high costs in medicine.
Comprehensive discharge planning is complex and requires a
multidisciplinary team approach.
Identification of patients at high risk for readmission should start
at admission.
High-risk patients need discharge planning throughout hospital
stay to identify potential barriers for a smooth discharge.
Communication 
with 
outpatient 
providers, 
patients, 
and
caregivers is vital.
Patients need clear discharge instructions and benefit from teach-
back to ensure understanding of clinical instructions.
Multiple models have shown multidisciplinary discharge planning
and follow-up can reduce readmissions.

31 Patient Safety in Radiation
Oncology
Hiram Gay and Sasa Mutic
CLINICAL VIGNETTE
A 55-year-old man presents to the emergency department with severe
lumbar back pain. Physical examination reveals pain over the lumbar spine,
decreased anal tone, and lower extremity weakness. Suspecting cauda
equina syndrome, a CT of the lumbar spine is ordered, which reveals
multiple lytic lumbar spine lesions. One of the lytic lesions at L4 has a 5-cm
soft tissue component that is compressing the cauda equina. A biopsy of the
soft tissue mass reveals clonal plasma cells. Further workup is consistent
with multiple myeloma. Radiation oncology is contacted Friday afternoon
for an urgent consult. Knowing that multiple myeloma is a very
radiosensitive tumor, the radiation oncologist acts hurriedly. The CT
treatment simulation is completed by 2 pm, and by 3 pm, the treatment plan
is complete. The radiation oncologist reviews and approves a simple
anteroposterior/posteroanterior (AP/PA) treatment plan delivering a
standard 3000 cGy in 10 fractions, and at 4 pm, the patient receives his first
treatment. With each treatment, the patient's symptoms improve, and at the
3-month follow-up, the patient is very grateful for eradicating his pain and
cauda equina symptoms. Six months later, the patient presents to the
emergency department with acute abdominal pain. Further workup reveals a
perforated small bowel. The patient dies of sepsis, and autopsy is consistent
with radiation necrosis of the small bowel. The radiation oncologist reviews
the patient's treatment plan and realizes that although the planning system
showed two beams, only the anterior beam delivered the treatment. Due to
the unusually large patient diameter, beam arrangement error, and 6-MV
lower energy photons, the end result was overdosing the bowel, which was
evident when displaying doses higher than the prescribed dose (see Fig. 31-
1).
Figure 31-1 Anteroposterior 6-MV beam delivering 3000 cGy in a
morbidly obese patient resulting in bowel overdose. If higher energies such
as 18 MV and AP/PA beam arrangement had been used, the high-dose
regions would have been greatly reduced.
What factors contributed to this fatal error?
What measures could have reduced the likelihood of this error?
INTRODUCTION
Cancer is a major public health problem in the US and many other parts of
the world. One in four deaths in the US is due to cancer. A total of
1,660,290 new cancer cases and 580,350 cancer deaths are projected to
occur in the US in 2013.1 Approximately two-thirds of cancer patients will
receive radiotherapy at some point. Patients who undergo radiation
treatments may experience both severe acute and late (chronic) effects with
a significant quality of life impact.2
The field of radiation oncology has experienced phenomenal advances
in technology in the past few decades resulting in systems of increased
complexity. One study showed that after the introduction of “high-
technology” machines, the deviation rates (data entry, calculation, chart
write-up, CT simulation, arithmetic, cerrobend block, patient/field setup,
total dose delivered, and others) declined with time, suggesting a learning
curve. Paradoxically, deviation rates increased in “low-technology”
machines suggestive of overreliance on tools inherent to “high-technology”
machines.3
Considering the large volume of radiation treatments delivered globally,
errors from the delivery of radiotherapy are uncommon and of very little
clinical impact.4 Nevertheless, radiation safety has been under scrutiny by
the public and the media, especially after the 2010 article in the New York
Times titled “Radiation Offers New Cures, and Ways to Do Harm.”5 The
article featured three cancer patients who died in New York from accidental
radiation overdoses during treatment. More recently, two French doctors
and a radiologist were sentenced to 18 months in prison for radiation
overdoses to nearly 450 patients, which resulted in the death of at least 12
patients.6 The doctors were charged with manslaughter, failure to help
people in danger, and destroying evidence. Unfortunately, there is no pill,
elixir, or procedure that will erase the damage from radiation. At present,
physicians can only symptomatically manage the acute and chronic
symptoms of radiotherapy. In this chapter, we highlight several strategies to
improve radiotherapy patient safety.
Types of Errors
Errors in radiation oncology can be human, software, hardware, or any
combination of the previous three. The errors can be random, affecting one
to a handful of patients, or systematic, affecting hundreds of patients. The
errors can result in overdosing or underdosing patients, and these are known
as dosimetric errors. Both types of errors, overdosing and underdosing, can
result in severe harm to patients: the former from unexpected complications
and the latter from not giving enough radiation to control the tumor and
subsequent poor outcomes. There are also geographical errors where the
wrong anatomical structure is irradiated. The dosimetric errors can be in
order of few percent to lethal overdoses that are delivered in a matter of
minutes. Similarly, geographical errors can range from a few millimeters to
the completely wrong anatomical structure or patient being irradiated.
Depending on the individual patient situation and error type, errors of even
minor magnitude can sometimes have devastating results. Due to this
potential, it is highly desirable to deliver doses within 5% of that prescribed
by the physician, which typically allows for geometric uncertainties on the
order of a few millimeters.
An analysis of two radiotherapy incident reporting databases revealed
that 53% of incidents were human only, 32% human–software, 10%
human–human, 2% hardware, and 4% others.7 The most common errors
were mismatch in data systems, incorrectly identified digitally
reconstructed radiographs (DRRs), incorrect patient shifts, suboptimal
treatment plans, manual data entry errors, and inadvertent treatment
parameter change. All of these incidents had a potential of severe harm to
the patient. The study emphasized the need for design improvements using
human factors engineering approaches and partnership with industry.
Examples of some errors that could result in an incorrect dose to a patient
are as follows8:
Incorrect field shape.
Reversed jaw settings. Treatment machines have four “jaws” used to
block the treatment field and create squares or rectangles of different
dimensions. These jaws have x and y coordinates specified as X1 (left
jaw), X2 (right jaw), Y1 (lower jaw), and Y2 (upper jaw), which have
nothing to do with the patient's orientation. If the x- and y-axis settings
are reversed, the field shape will be incorrect and the patient will be
improperly treated.
Incorrect wedge direction. A wedge is a radiation beam modifier that
causes a progressive decrease in the intensity across the beam.
Physical wedges are inserted in the beam path using a wedge tray. If
the wedge is inserted in an incorrect direction, the dose delivered to the
patient will be different from what was planned, with some areas
overdosed and others underdosed. The worst-case scenario is when the
wedge is not inserted by mistake, resulting in significantly overdosing
the patient. These types of errors have resulted in chest wall ulceration
and blindness.
Incorrect photon energy. This type of error can happen when a patient
is transferred to a machine with different energies from the machine
originally planned. For example, switching from 18- to 6-MV photons.
In a parallel-opposed beam situation, this error could result in
overdosing the entrance region of the beams.
Incorrect electron energy. For example, the physician may have
intended to treat with 16-MeV electrons, but instead, the dose
calculations are based on 6-MeV electrons, which would have less
penetration and grossly underdose the target.
Radiation oncologists should take special care when treating patients
palliatively as in the clinical vignette. These urgent palliative treatments for
reducing bone pain, spinal cord compression, cauda equina syndrome,
superior vena cava syndrome, brain metastases, or leptomeningeal disease
are sometimes called in for consult late in the treatment day or during the
weekend when the clinical staff may be reduced. Since these palliative
treatments are usually simple and radiation oncologists are very familiar
with these techniques, complacency can result in overlooking a critical error
that could result in patient harm including:
Incorrect beam shape. For example, omitting blocks on a whole-brain
field or too wide of a cervical, thoracic, and/or lumbar spinal field.
Suboptimal beam energy. Treating the spine of an obese patient with
large body habitus with 6-MV photons instead of using a higher energy
beam capable of limiting the amount of radiation received by healthy
tissues near the tumor as illustrated in Figure 31-1.
Making a mistake in a manual radiation dose calculation during the
weekend when there may not be any physics or dosimetry support to
verify the calculation.
Setting up a spine field at the treatment machine where the
megavoltage images are blurry because Compton scatter mechanism
dominates at these high energies unlike kV x-rays where the
photoelectric effect predominates. The photoelectric effect depends
strongly on the atomic number, Z3, and explains the excellent contrast
between soft tissue and bone seen on kV x-rays. These blurry images
are sometimes hard to interpret and could result in treating the
incorrect vertebral bodie(s). Ideally, a conventional (kilovoltage)
simulation or CT simulation should be performed.
Treating a very ill patient (e.g., on a ventilator) during the weekend
when there may be no or limited nursing staff and additional medical
personnel if there is an emergency.
Situations where things are rushed should be approached with caution, and
the use of checklists, timeouts, and double checks should be considered
whenever possible in these situations.
Radiation equipment calibration errors arguably have caused the most
harm to patients. The previously mentioned overdosing incident in France6
resulted from both miscalibration of the radiation therapy machines with an
approximate 20% overdose for some patients and human error resulting in
miscalculating the total radiation dose with an 8–10% overdose for most
patients. In the US, approximately 400 cancer patients were overdosed from
1975 to 1976 at Riverside Methodist hospital in Columbus, Ohio.9 Again,
human error resulting in miscalibration of a cobalt-60 radiotherapy machine
caused up to 40% overdoses. For example, due to the nonlinear biologic
effects of radiation, a 5% increase in dose may have a >5% biologic impact.
Depending on the organs at risk, large overdosing errors of 40% could
result in significant normal tissue damage or death.
Error Detection
The optimal combination of quality control checks to detect radiotherapy
errors is unknown. One study showed that 97% of errors could potentially
be detected with seven quality control checks: physician chart review,
physics chart review, timeout by therapist prior to treating patient, physics
weekly chart check, electronic portal imaging device (EPID) dosimetry at
the first treatment, checklist of safety-related workflow processes (Fig. 31-
2), and one of the following: source-to-skin distance (SSD) check, port film
check by a therapist, or online CT check before treatment and weekly
thereafter by a therapist.10

Oncology Unit. (Reproduced with permission from Ford EC, et al.

radiation oncology. Med Phys. 2012;39(12):7272.)
Physician Credentialing
Radiation oncologists receive their board certification from the American
Board of Radiology. Certification requires the successful completion of a
radiation oncology residency; a three-part computer examination covering
radiation physics, radiobiology, and clinical radiation oncology; and an oral
examination. Certification is renewed every 10 years. In addition, prior to
starting to work, radiation oncologists undergo an institution-specific
credentialing process.
Radiation Clinic Credentialing
Both the American College of Radiology (ACR) and the American College
of Radiation Oncology (ACRO) offer accreditation for radiation oncology
facilities. The accreditation process may include a review of the radiation
therapy process including consultation, informed consent, treatment
planning, simulation, radiation treatment delivery, treatment verification,
follow-up care, policies and procedures, personnel, equipment, medical
physics quality assurance, quality assurance, and safety policies among
others.
Current Case/Weekly Patient Conference
The current case or weekly conference is an opportunity for the physicians
and treatment team to review all the new patients starting treatment. The
appropriateness of the radiation prescription, treatment volume, and dose
volume histograms (DVHs) are reviewed. Each line in Figure 31-3
illustrates the DVH for a given target or normal structure (such as the spinal
cord, oral cavity, brainstem, parotid glands, and others). The Quantitative
Analysis of Normal Tissue Effects in the Clinic (QUANTEC) reviews
published in 2010 provide normal tissue dose constraints for multiple
organs that help radiation oncologists minimize toxicity and evaluate these
DVHs. The starting patient's setup pictures, clinical history, diagnosis,
staging, tumor laterality, prescription, and treatment plan are carefully
reviewed. Depending on the radiation team's recommendation(s), a
physician may decide to change the treatment plan or prescription.

different organ at risk or target. This represents a small partial list of all the
organs at risk analyzed. The y-axis is the normalized volume from 0 to 1
(where 1 = 100%).
Peer Review
Performance and documentation of quarterly peer review is required for
ACR accreditation. In this process, each radiation oncologist has various
random cases reviewed by one or more peers using a checklist covering
questions like:
Is the problem for which the patient was referred clearly described in
the history and physical?
Is the patient's cancer stage and tumor laterality documented
accurately?
Does the treatment plan address the problem for which the patient was
referred?
Is the patient's care consistent with treatment guidelines? National
Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)? Institutional?
Are dose constraints defined in advance of the patient's treatment
planning?
Has the patient been seen by an attending physician weekly?
Were problems identified with/during treatment?
If changes occurred during the course of treatment, is the decision
supporting the change documented?
Is there evidence that the patient's documents and treatment images are
being reviewed according to department policy?
Does the completion of therapy note accurately reflect the treatment
delivered?
Was the patient's tolerance to treatment consistent with expectations?
Is there evidence of ongoing follow-up?
Mortality and Morbidity
The mortality and morbidity (M&M) conference has long been a part of the
practice of medicine. For the field of radiation oncology, the conference
involves the peer review of radiotherapy treatments and their potential role
in a patient experiencing unexpected side effects or death. Treatment errors
and near-misses are also discussed. The conference is confidential and
nonpunitive, with the goal of preventing the repetition of errors and
improving the process(es) that may have led to an error. The conferences
are held at regular intervals, often monthly, and involve physicians,
physicists, dosimetrists, therapists, nurses, and other clinic staff.
Quality Assurance 
and 
Data 
Safety
Monitoring Committee (QASMC)
To maintain National Cancer Institute (NCI) designation, research data
including those from patients participating in clinical trials are subject to a
quality assurance review. The roles of the QASMC include reviewing all
the serious adverse events (SAEs) from institutional, cooperative group,
multi-institutional, and pharmaceutical studies. The QASMC also reviews
the data and safety monitoring (DSM) reports submitted by principal
investigators (PIs) or trial-specific DSM committees. Consequently,
toxicities occurring in clinical trials employing radiotherapy are carefully
monitored, and the trial's informed consent document is updated as
necessary based on the toxicities observed. For patient safety, a trial may be
suspended or terminated if toxicity exceeds the toxicity thresholds specified
in the protocol or unforeseen unacceptable toxicities are observed.
Simulation and Treatment Planning Order
Standardization
Standardization of processes such as treatment simulations can help
minimize errors.11 For example, most head and neck tumors can be treated
with the same patient simulation parameters. Creating templates with
specific treatment parameters for common tumor and anatomical treatment
scenarios ensures consistency and minimizes errors. At Washington
University in St. Louis, the SIMulation and treatment PLanning Electronic
(SIMPLE) web-based order system was implemented.11 The process
improvement methods followed the DMAIIC formalism where the process
is understood as comprising Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve,
Implement, and Control activities. These templates have the following
information (see Fig. 31-4):

Normal tissue dose constraints
Treatment 
Planning 
Nomenclature
Standardization
Each radiotherapy treatment plan may have one or more organs at risk
contoured by the radiation oncologist. A standard head and neck plan has
more than 20 normal structures generating DVHs as in Figure 31-3. One
area that may increase safety is consistently contouring a number of
pertinent organs at risk for a given clinical scenario and also consistently
naming these structures to facilitate communication between different
institutions and collaborative databases. A standardized naming convention
has been proposed and will be used by radiation oncology cooperative
groups.12
Contouring Atlases
A number of contouring atlases have been published that illustrate how to
correctly contour the organs at risk and targets for various anatomical areas
and clinical scenarios. This should help minimize interobserver variability
when contouring these structures. The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group
(RTOG) has published various atlases online, and we provide the link at the
end of this chapter.
Error Reporting Culture and Incident
Reporting
Incident reporting is crucial for improving safety in the field of radiation
oncology. 
Successful 
reporting 
systems 
have 
the 
following
characteristics13,14:
Nonpunitive: freedom from retaliation or punishment.
Confidential: individuals involved in incident are never revealed to a
third party.
Independent: the reporting system is independent of a punitive
authority.
Expert analysis: reports are evaluated by experts.
Timely: rapid analysis of the incident and dissemination to those who
need to know.
Systems oriented: focus on changing systems, processes, and products
rather than individual performance.
Responsive: 
an 
agency 
disseminates 
recommendations, 
and
participating organizations agree to implement them.
The success of any incident reporting and learning requires a clear
institutional commitment.
The Radiation Oncology Safety Information System (ROSIS)
established under the auspices of the European Society for Radiotherapy
and Oncology (ESTRO) and SAFRON from the International Atomic
Energy Agency (IAEA) are examples of voluntary incident or near-incident
repot systems. Their web links are provided at the end of this chapter. A
publication on the first 1074 reports submitted to ROSIS between 2003 and
2008 noted that the treatment therapists detected 56% of the incidents,
physicists 9%, oncologists 8%, therapists at the simulator or CT 5%,
dosimetrists 4%, others 3%, and unknown 15%.15
Specific to the field of radiation oncology, the American Association of
Physicists in Medicine (AAPM), the American Society for Radiation
Oncology (ASTRO), and the Society of Radiation Oncology Administrators
(SROA) published the consensus guidelines for incident learning database
structures in radiation oncology.16 The publication includes the following:
Definitions of key terms from the patient safety literature.
Process maps describing the key steps in the workflow. This allows
codifying each incident in terms of its origin along the radiotherapy
workflow.
Severity metrics: a medical severity scale and a dose deviation scale.
Causal taxonomy listing the root causes and contributory factors
relevant to radiation oncology.
Data elements tables.
Quality Assurance and Quality Control
In addition to above-described measures, the underpinnings of radiation
therapy safety are numerous quality assurance (QA) and quality control
(QC) steps. These include periodic (daily, weekly, monthly, annual, etc.)
quality assurance of practically all pieces of software and hardware used for
patient treatments. All this equipment also undergoes rigorous and well-
defined testing prior to clinical implementation. Individual patient data and
records are audited and double-checked throughout the treatment process.
Many critical elements are double checked more than once. At Washington
University, many of the QA/QC steps have also been automated, in addition
to human checks, resulting in a system with human and electronic parallel
checks designed to ensure high confidence in treatment integrity.17–21
KEY POINTS
The worst radiotherapy errors overdose the normal tissues
resulting in patient harm and underdose the tumor resulting in a
tumor recurrence, both of which could cause the patient's death.
Errors in radiation oncology can be human, software, hardware,
or any combination of the previous three.
A combination of multiple checks during the radiation workflow
can prevent most errors.
Radiation calibration errors can have the most devastating effects
affecting large numbers of patients if undetected for a long period
of time.
Incident reporting is crucial for improving safety in the field of
radiation oncology.

CLINICAL VIGNETTE
Mr. S, a 78-year-old man with ischemic cardiomyopathy, was admitted
to the hospital for congestive heart failure exacerbation. At the time of his
initial medical evaluation, he informed his medical team that he wished to
have a “do not resuscitate/do not intubate” (DNR/DNI) status. Accordingly,
DNR/DNI status was documented in both the paper chart and the electronic
medical record (EMR). Later that evening, the EMR was down and paper
charting was used. During that time, Mr. S was found unresponsive and in
respiratory distress. The code team was called. Mr. S was resuscitated,
intubated, and transferred to the intensive care unit, where he was sedated
and received invasive respiratory support by mechanical ventilation. When
the medical team contacted the patient's family, Mr. S's son stated that his
father “did not want to be on life support.” The family arrived and requested
that the patient be taken off sedation, life support stopped, and comfort
measures provided. Mr. S died shortly thereafter. You are on the committee
reviewing the case and have been assigned to write a report of the findings.
What are the appropriate terms to describe this scenario? Error, injury,
harmful incident, adverse event? Is this a sentinel event?
Was there a system failure?

INTRODUCTION
Patient safety and the related field of quality improvement in health care
have a vocabulary that borrows from a variety of disciplines, including
engineering, industry, business, cognitive psychology, and government
regulatory agencies. Patient safety and quality improvement initiatives in
health care have also generated a number of terms unique to those fields.
The World Health Organization (WHO) conceptual framework for the
International Classification for Patient Safety attempts to organize and
schematize relationships between various broad concepts within the field of
patient safety (Fig. G-1).1 This framework is part of an extensive technical
document that attempts to delineate “standardized sets of concepts with
agreed definitions, preferred terms and the relationships between them.”1
Although the WHO framework provides a systematic approach to
classifying patient safety events, it also highlights the complexity of the
many concepts and terms used in the field of patient safety. Moreover, it
illustrates the difficulty in reaching standardized definitions for specific
terms that are valid across various disciplines and geographic boundaries.
Figure G-1 The conceptual framework for the international classification
for patient safety. (Reproduced with permission from the World Health
Organization.)
A number of groups have attempted to develop standard definitions for the
most commonly used terms in patient safety, but these often vary between
sources and may be inconsistent, depending on the context. Terms and
definitions relating to quality of care and patient safety come from health
care providers, professional societies, health care administrators, regulatory
agencies, and public health organizations at the local, regional, national, or
international levels, and they are used in medical, legal, regulatory,
economic, and even sociologic settings. This array of sources and uses
creates a considerable challenge to offering concise, widely accepted, and
specific definitions for many important terms in patient safety and quality.
For example, the term “sentinel event” has a number of definitions with
potentially different medical, legal, and ethical implications (Table G-1).
(Note that the WHO lists multiple definitions from multiple sources for its
entry on “sentinel event.”1) It is generally agreed that a sentinel event is an
unexpected and possibly preventable adverse event in which serious harm
has occurred. However, not all sources agree on (or even address) what
constitutes serious harm, what types of events would be considered
unexpected, whether such an event requires investigation, or whether the
occurrence of a sentinel event is indicative of “serious problems in current
policies or procedures.” Thus, it can be difficult to determine the
appropriate response to a potential sentinel event or even to establish
whether or not a sentinel event occurred.
Table G-1 Definition of “Sentinel Event”
Given the challenges described above and ongoing debates surrounding the
exact definitions of many terms, this chapter provides only a brief
introduction to common terms used in the fields of patient safety and
quality, beginning with several “core” terms that aid in providing context
and framework for the broader vocabulary. Because a complete listing of
terms is beyond the scope of this chapter, selected terms and definitions are
subsequently listed. For more extensive lists of terms and definitions, we
encourage the reader to explore the references provided at the end of this
chapter, many of which have been used to create the definitions in this
glossary.
CORE TERMS
Patient Safety
This term was first used in a manner consistent with its modern usage in a
1960 article addressing the relative safety of regional versus general
anesthesia in obstetric patients.7 Since that time, the term has continued to
evolve and grow. Narrowly considered, patient safety refers to freedom
from preventable or accidental injury during the course of medical care.1,8,9
In a broader context, patient safety can also denote the discipline that
applies safety science to the processes of health care delivery to minimize
errors, injuries, and adverse outcomes.1,8–10
Quality
Prior to its usage in health care, the concept of quality came into popular
use in industry, particularly manufacturing. W. Edwards Deming famously
conceptualized the term as “Quality = (Results of work efforts)/(Cost).”8 In
health care, the results of work efforts are the diagnosis and treatment of
patients as well as the extent to which health services provide the desired
outcomes. However, on a more practical level, defining, quantifying, and
improving quality of health care is a source of ongoing discussion and
debate, and multiple frameworks have been proposed. The IOM defines
quality by six adjectives that describe care: safe, effective, patient centered,
timely, efficient, and equitable.11 Multiple measures of quality in health
care (quality metrics) have been developed in an effort to quantify the
quality of care delivered. Quality metrics often rely on administrative data
and readily available clinical information to assess quality at every level of
care, from prevention to treatment, outpatient to inpatient, or patient to
population. Various tools used to improve quality metrics in health care
have been adapted from manufacturing and include Total Quality
Management, Six Sigma, Lean methodology, and Continuous Quality
Improvement.
System(s)
Systems are composed of multiple, interconnected, interacting, and/or
interdependent components (e.g., personnel, equipment, and processes).
Health care providers function within and as part of systems in their daily
work. Individual components may affect the function of the system as
whole as well as the functioning of other components. Characteristics of a
system include structure (components and the manner in which they are
organized), behavior (conversion of input to output), and interconnectivity
(relationships and connections between components). Understanding health
care outcomes, positive or negative, as the result of a system represents a
departure from the traditional model that focused almost exclusively on
individuals. With the traditional model, organizations frequently responded
to negative outcomes and errors through punishment of often well-intending
individuals (i.e., blame and shame). Systems thinking goes beyond the level
of the individual and provides an alternative framework to understand and
alter factors that contribute to the occurrence of errors.
Error
As with many terms in health care, the definition of error overlaps with
other terms (e.g., mistake, adverse event, negligence), and its precise
meaning is actively debated. The landmark report “To Err is Human”
defines medical error as “failure of a planned action to be completed as
intended or the use of a wrong plan to achieve an aim.”9 Errors can result
from either commission or omission and may be divided into the following
types based on system and cognitive approaches:
Systems-Based Classification
Active errors are unsafe acts committed by personnel in direct contact
with the patient or system. They take a variety of forms: slips, lapses,
fumbles, or mistakes.
Latent errors are attributes of the system placed by designers or
management that provoke further errors or create an inherent weakness
in the system.
Cognitive Classification
Skill-based errors are those when the action made is not the intended
one.
Rule-based errors occur when the action and intention match, but the
desired outcome is not attained due to misapplication of a
predetermined response pattern (“if X, then do Y”).
Knowledge-based errors are those in which the actions taken are
intended but do not have the desired outcome due to a deficiency of
information.9
KEY TERMS
Adverse event: An undesired injury cause by medical care (i.e.,
diagnosis or therapy) rather than the underlying disease or condition of
the patient; it does not imply “error,” “negligence,” or poor care.
Ameliorating actions: Steps taken or circumstances altered to improve
or compensate for any harm after an incident.
Benchmark: Attribute or achievement that serves as a point of
reference or standard by which the performance of providers or
institutions may be compared or judged.
Best practice: A technique, practice, or method that has been shown to
achieve consistently better results than alternatives. Best practice also
functions as a benchmark by which other methods can be measured.
Briefing: A conversation sharing relevant information prior to a
procedure or activity (e.g., surgical “time-out”).
Close call: An event or situation that may have resulted in patient
injury, but did not, either due to chance or timely intervention (also
known as near miss).
Closed-loop communication: Dialogue in which the recipient of an
instruction repeats or clarifies the task in order to affirm that he or she
understands and will complete the task and to notify the team leader
when the task has been completed.
Contributing factors: A circumstance, action, or influence that may
have increased the risk or led to the development of an incident. (See
also error.) Core measures: Quality metrics used to determine health
care organization performance and compare quality of health care
delivery across institutions. The most commonly used core measures are
those developed by The Joint Commission (TJC) and the Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), which are national, evidence-
based quality indicators for various settings and disease processes.
Examples of core measurement areas include acute myocardial
infarction, tobacco treatment, and childhood immunization. (See also
“Quality” section in “Core Terms in Patient Safety.”) Crew resource
management (CRM): Also called “crisis resource management.” A
range of approaches, developed initially in the aviation industry, for
training groups to function as teams rather than as collections of
individuals. CRM emphasizes the role of “human factors,” management
styles, 
and 
organizational 
cultures 
on 
high-stress, 
high-risk
environments. (See also human factors.) Critical language: Key
phrases understood by all team members to mean “Stop and listen, we
have a potential problem.” Specific phrases may differ from one
institution or unit to another.
Debriefing: A conversation sharing relevant information following a
procedure or activity; identifies what went well, what could have been
done differently, and what was learned.
Disclosure (error disclosure): Notification of an adverse event to the
affected patient or patient advocate. Elements of disclosure may include
statement of all harmful errors, an explanation of the error(s), possible
effects of the error, how the error's effects will be minimized, steps
taken to prevent recurrences, acknowledgement of responsibility, and/or
an apology. Disclosure is often a process and not a single event.
Error: See above entry in “Core Terms in Patient Safety.”
Failure to rescue: Shorthand for “failure to rescue from a complication
of an underlying illness or complication of medical care.” In other
words, it is an inability to prevent or adequately respond to an important
clinical deterioration, such as death or permanent disability (e.g.,
cardiac arrest in a patient with acute myocardial infarction or major
hemorrhage after thrombolysis for acute myocardial infarction).
Forcing function: An aspect of a design that prevents a behavior from
continuing until the problem has been corrected.
Handoffs, handovers, sign-outs: The process of exchanging
information about a patient's health status (e.g., condition, care,
treatment, medications, services, and any recent or expected changes)
from one health care professional to another for the purpose of taking
over the patient's care. In general, handoffs should be accurate, clear,
and complete, but this can be challenging due to the need to be concise,
unstructured handoff procedures, and attending to other demands of
patient care. Handoffs are areas of particular concern in patient safety,
as important details may be missed or information may be
misinterpreted during the handover process.
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA):
Federal regulations first introduced in 1996 to increase patient privacy
and security during transmission of “protected health information”
among providers, payors, or other health care entities. “Protected health
information” includes medical records and health care payment history.
Health literacy: Individuals' ability to find, process, and comprehend
basic health information necessary to act on medical instructions and
make decisions about their health.
Heuristics: Informal rules (i.e., “rules of thumb”) developed through
trial and error that are used to complete a judgment or make a decision.
Although heuristics are important tools that allow providers to respond
promptly to urgent or complex situations, they may also be wrong or
applied inappropriately, leading to medical errors.
High-reliability organizations (HROs): Organizations or systems that
operate in high-risk environments yet have fewer adverse events than
expected. Features of HROs include (1) preoccupation with failure,
which acknowledges the error-prone nature of the organization's
activities and strives to achieve consistent safety; (2) commitment to
resilience, developing mechanisms within the system to detect, contain,
mitigate, or recover from unexpected threats; (3) sensitivity to
operations, in which frontline workers are attentive to potential issues
and are empowered to respond to such threats; and (4) a culture of
safety.
Hindsight bias: The tendency to regard past occurrences as expected or
obvious, while in real time, they may have been unexpected or
confusing. In the context of patient safety, it refers to the tendency to
judge the events leading up to a negative outcome as errors because the
negative outcome is already known. As a result, those reviewing an
adverse event after the fact may deem an outcome as more foreseeable
and more preventable than if they had been observing the event in real
time.
Human-centered 
design, 
human 
factors, 
human 
factors
engineering: A discipline that attempts to support or enhance human
performance by identifying and addressing safety problems that occur in
the interactions between humans, the tools and equipment they use, and
the environments in which they live and work.
Iatrogenic: Pertaining to illness or injury resulting from medical care
rather than from an underlying disease process.
Informed consent: The process in which a physician or physician
representative presents to a patient the risks and benefits of a proposed
therapy or test and then allows the patient to decide whether or not to
undergo the procedure discussed. The term can also be used to mean the
patient's authorization to perform a proposed therapy or test after such a
discussion.
Just culture: An environment in which individuals feel comfortable
reporting errors (including their own), balanced by the need to maintain
professional accountability. In such an environment, there is recognition
that even competent individuals make mistakes, and moreover, they
should not be held responsible for systemic problems over which they
have no control. However, individuals in a just culture should still be
responsible for their own actions, and reckless behavior or misconduct
is not tolerated.
Mistake: An error in which the intended action is performed, but the
desired outcome is not achieved, either due to lack of knowledge or
misinterpretation 
(i.e., 
a 
knowledge-based 
error) 
or 
through
misapplication of a rule (i.e., a rule-based error). All mistakes are errors,
but not all errors are mistakes. Mistakes may be addressed by improving
education or increasing supervision, but other types of errors, such as
slips or fumbles caused by lapses in concentration, or latent errors
within the system, must be addressed through different mechanisms.
(See also “Error” section in “Core Terms in Patient Safety.”) Mitigating
factor: An action or circumstance that prevents or diminishes the
progression of an incident toward harming a patient.
Near miss: See close call.
Patient safety: See above entry in “Core Terms in Patient Safety.”
Quality: See above entry in “Core Terms in Patient Safety.”
Resilience: In the context of systems engineering, the ability of a
system to recover from or adapt to an unexpected event. Resilient
systems strive to achieve safety by relying on human judgment to assess
safety concerns and human adaptability to manage adverse events. In
sharp contrast, “ultrasafe” systems strive to achieve safety by
establishing constraints that simplify processes and limit worker
autonomy.
Risk management: Self-protective activities and strategies meant to
prevent real or potential threats of financial loss due to accident, injury,
or medical malpractice strategies through actions that minimize
potential risks that could lead to injury of patients, staff members, or
visitors.12
Root cause: The most fundamental reason an event has occurred.
Root cause analysis: A systematic process for identifying the
underlying cause or contributing factors for an adverse event or
incident. (See also root cause.) Safety culture: An integrated pattern of
individual and organizational behavior that continuously seeks to
minimize harm, which may result from the processes of care delivery.
Safety culture permeates all levels of an organization, from frontline
workers to management and executives. Features include (1)
acknowledgment 
of 
the 
high-risk, 
error-prone 
nature 
of 
an
organization's activities, (2) a blame-free environment where
individuals are able to report errors or close calls without punishment,
(3) an expectation of collaboration across ranks to seek solutions to
vulnerabilities, and (4) a willingness on the part of the organization to
direct resources to address safety concerns.
SBAR: 
Stands 
for 
“Situation, 
Background, Assessment, 
and
Recommendation.” A standard communication technique that provides a
framework for conveying information between members of a health
care team, particularly those requiring immediate attention and action.
Sentinel event: An unexpected adverse event in which death or serious
harm to a patient has occurred (see Table G-1).
Six Sigma: A set of quality improvement techniques that seek to
provide near-perfect outcomes. “Sigma” refers to the Greek letter used
to refer to the standard deviation of a normally distributed population; 2
standard deviations (“2 sigma”) encompass 95% of the population being
considered. Six Sigma processes target a defect rate of 3.4 defects per
million (99.99966% success without defect); in actuality, this is 4.5
sigma, but a 1.5 sigma “shift” has been introduced into the calculation
to account for long-term process variations.
Standard of care: Often a term associated with medical legal issues,
meaning the degree of skill and care that a competent practitioner would
exercise under similar circumstances. More generally, the standard of
care indicates a treatment strategy or regimen accepted by medical
experts as appropriate treatment for diseases.
Standard work: A description of each work activity, specifying cycle
time, rate of demand for the product of the activity, sequences of
specific tasks, and the minimum inventory of supplies to complete the
activity.
Systems, systems approach, system improvement: See above entry in
“Core Terms in Patient Safety.”
Ultrasafe: See resilience.
